---

## 3) Ownership & Warranties

---

---

## 5) No Obligation to Use
The Copyright Holder is under no obligation to use, merge, publish, or distribute any Contribution.

---

## 6) Revenue Sharing
The Copyright Holder operates **two distinct revenue-sharing systems**:  

---

### 6.1 Contributor Pool — Creative Work (25%)
If the Copyright Holder commercially publishes or otherwise monetizes the Work through **book sales only** (including printed books, e-books, and audiobooks), the Copyright Holder will allocate **25% of Net Book Sales Revenue** as a **Contributor Pool** to be shared among all *creative contributors* of that book.

**Net Book Sales Revenue** means gross receipts actually received by the Copyright Holder from book sales **minus** direct, third-party costs for those sales (e.g., printing, distribution/platform fees, payment processor fees, sales/VAT/GST, reasonable shipping/fulfillment for physical editions).  
It specifically **excludes** all other forms of revenue, including but not limited to:
- Patreon membership income  
- Merchandise sales  
- Sponsorships or advertising  
- Licensing, adaptations, or derivative works not directly tied to book sales  

#### 6.1.1 Allocation Formula — Creative WEU
**Variables:**  
- **WEU_creative** = WEU accumulated from text, translations, images, audio, video, or other accepted non-text assets during the Book Tally Window (see Section 6.1.2).  
- **R** = Net Book Sales Revenue for the accounting period  
- **P** = Contributor Pool percentage (**25%**)  

**Payout Formula:**  
Contributor’s Payout = (WEU_creative ÷ ΣWEU_creative_all) × (P × R)  

#### 6.1.2 Book Tally Window — Scope and Duration
- A **separate tally is maintained for each book** in the saga.  
- The tally begins at the commencement of writing for that book.  
- The tally closes upon the publication of that book in all primary formats:  
  - **Text** (print and/or e-book)  
  - **Audio** (audiobook or other complete audio edition)  
- If formats are published at different times, the tally remains open until the last of these formats is published on at least one recognized commercial platform.  
- Once the tally closes, no further WEU are counted toward that book’s revenue share.  
- Each new book starts with a fresh tally beginning at zero.  

---

### 6.2 Sponsor Pool — Patreon Support (10%)
In recognition of financial support, the Copyright Holder will allocate **10% of Net Book Sales Revenue** as a **Sponsor Pool** to be shared among Patreon supporters for that book.  

#### 6.2.1 Allocation Formula — Sponsor WEU
**Variables:**  
- **WEU_sponsor** = WEU credited at **100 WEU per USD $1 pledged** per month of active subscription during the Book Tally Window  
- **R** = Net Book Sales Revenue for the accounting period  
- **P** = Sponsor Pool percentage (**10%**)  

**Payout Formula:**  
Sponsor’s Payout = (WEU_sponsor ÷ ΣWEU_sponsor_all) × (P × R)  

Sponsor WEU are credited only during the Book Tally Window and do not carry over to future books.

---

### 6.3 WEU Allocation (Creative Work)
To keep allocation fair across different types of contributions, all non-text work and translations are converted to **Word-Equivalent Units (WEU)** and added to the contributor’s tally for that book.  

| Contribution Type              | WEU Credit Formula                        | Notes |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------|
| **Text (original writing)**    | 1 WEU × words                             | Baseline for story content. |
| **Translation (incl. subtitles)** | τ × words (default τ = 0.60)             | Only target-language word count is credited. |
| **Images / illustrations**     | 0.00005 WEU × total pixels                | Width × height from file metadata. |
| **Audio narration**            | 100 WEU × finished minutes                | Mastered runtime, rounded up to nearest 0.1 min. |
| **Original music**             | 150 WEU × finished minutes                | Composed runtime in minutes. |
| **Video (trailers / motion)**  | 250 WEU × finished minutes                | Final exported runtime. |

### 6.4 Examples
1) **Illustrator + Writer**  
- 2 accepted illustrations (e.g., 1000 WEU total)  
- 3,200 words (3,200 WEU)  
- WEU_creative = 4,200 → Share of 25% Contributor Pool  

2) **Translator (EN → ES)**  
- 18,000 Spanish target-language words  
- τ = 0.60 → 10,800 WEU → Share of 25% Contributor Pool  

3) **Video Editor**  
- 90-second trailer (1.5 min) → 375 WEU → Share of 25% Contributor Pool  

4) **Audio Team**  
- 5-minute narrated chapter: Narrator 500 WEU; Mixer 375 WEU → Share of 25% Contributor Pool  

5) **Patreon Sponsor**  
- $20 pledged for 6 months = $120 → 12,000 WEU_sponsor → Share of 10% Sponsor Pool

### 6.5 Direct Project Revenue Share — Extras & Side Material
If a Contributor produces an original, standalone piece of content **outside the main path of the Work** (e.g., side stories, lore compendiums, illustrations, music, videos, or other extras) and the Copyright Holder sells that item separately (e.g., as a paid post on Patreon or via other channels), the following applies:

- The Creator of that item will receive **75% of Net Revenue** from that specific item.  
- The Copyright Holder retains the remaining **25%**.  
- This revenue is **not** included in the Main Contributor Pool.  
- This content does **not** count toward WEU tallies unless the Creator decides to submit it into the main Work.  
- Net Revenue for extras is defined as gross receipts from the sale of that item minus direct, third-party costs for that sale.

The scope and classification of an item as “extra” will be determined by the Copyright Holder before publication.

---

## 7) Reporting
At each payout, the Copyright Holder will provide a brief summary of:
- Net Book Sales Revenue for the period,  
- Total WEU counted for the book, and  
- Each Contributor’s WEU used in the allocation.  

For extras, a per-item revenue report with the Creator’s share will be provided.

---

## 8) Governing Law
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the **United States of America**, without regard to its conflicts of law principles.

---

## 9) Miscellaneous
This is the entire agreement regarding Contributions, superseding any prior understandings.  
If any provision is held unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect.  
This Agreement may be updated prospectively by posting a revised version in the repository; submitting Contributions after such posting constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
