# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

**Project:** Edges of Light  
**Copyright Holder:** Or Gal

By submitting any content (“Contribution”) to this repository, you agree to the following terms.

---

## 1) Definitions
- **Work**: The contents of this repository and any future collected or published editions based on it.  
- **Contribution / Contributor**: Original text or other content you submit and that is merged into the main branch.  
- **Words Changed**: For a given Contributor, the total number of words **added plus deleted** in merged commits to `main`, measured using the Git history.  
  - Words Changed are **counted forever** — once credited, they remain in the tally for all future revenue-sharing, even if later altered or removed.  
  - Edits that delete or modify another person’s text still count toward the editor’s Words Changed.  
  - Unmerged pull requests do not count.

---

## 2) Grant of Rights
You grant the Copyright Holder an **exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license** to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, display, and create derivative works from your Contribution in any form or medium, including for commercial purposes, subject to the revenue-sharing terms in Section 6.

---

## 3) Ownership & Warranties
You represent and warrant that you own or control all rights in your Contribution and that it does not infringe any third-party rights. This Agreement does not transfer ownership of your underlying authorship, but it grants the exclusive license described above.

---

## 4) Moral Rights
To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive any moral rights you may have in your Contribution.

---

## 5) No Obligation to Use
The Copyright Holder is under no obligation to use, merge, publish, or distribute any Contribution.

---

## 6) Revenue Sharing
If the Copyright Holder commercially publishes or otherwise monetizes the Work (e.g., printed book, e-book, audiobook, licenses, adaptations, or similar), the Copyright Holder will allocate **25% of Net Revenue** as a **Contributor Pool** to be shared among all Contributors.

**Net Revenue** means gross receipts actually received by the Copyright Holder from monetization of the Work **minus** direct, third-party costs for that monetization (e.g., printing, distribution/platform fees, payment processor fees, sales/VAT/GST, reasonable shipping/fulfillment for physical editions). General overhead and unrelated income are excluded.

**Allocation Formula (for each accounting period):** 

**Variables:**  
- **Wc** = Words Changed by a specific Contributor (lifetime total, added + deleted)  
- **Wt** = Total Words Changed by all Contributors (lifetime total, added + deleted)  
- **R** = Net Revenue for the accounting period  
- **P** = Percentage of Net Revenue allocated to the Contributor Pool (25%)

**Formula:**  
Contributor’s Payout = (Wc ÷ Wt) × (P × R)

**Example Calculation:**  
- Wc = 12,000  
- Wt = 60,000  
- R = $10,000  
- P = 25% (0.25)  

1. Contributor’s share of words = 12,000 ÷ 60,000 = 0.20 (20%)  
2. Contributor Pool = 0.25 × $10,000 = $2,500  
3. Contributor’s Payout = 0.20 × $2,500 = **$500**  

**Notes:**  
- Words Changed are lifetime totals and never expire.  
- All payouts are proportional to each Contributor’s share of Words Changed relative to the total.  
- The Contributor Pool is always exactly 25% of Net Revenue for the period.

**Notes:**
- Words Changed are cumulative from project start and **never expire**. Contributors continue to share in all future monetization based on their lifetime Words Changed tally.  
- Later deletions or edits do not reduce credited Words Changed.  
- Only merged Contributions to `main` count toward Words Changed.  
- Non-text assets (images, audio, etc.) are not included in Words Changed unless the Copyright Holder publishes a written, project-wide conversion rule for such assets.

**Payout Schedule & Threshold:**  
- Payments will be made semi-annually, within 60 days after each 6-month period ends.  
- Minimum payout is **$50 USD** per Contributor per period; amounts below the threshold roll forward.  
- Unclaimed amounts (e.g., if valid payment details are not provided) expire after 24 months and revert to the Copyright Holder.

**Taxes & Compliance:**  
Contributors are responsible for any taxes on their payouts. The Copyright Holder may require reasonable information (e.g., tax forms) before payment.

---

## 7) Reporting
At each payout, the Copyright Holder will provide a brief summary of:
- Net Revenue for the period,  
- Total Words Changed counted, and  
- Each Contributor’s Words Changed used in the allocation.

---

## 8) Governing Law
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the **United States of America**, without regard to its conflicts of law principles.

---

## 9) Miscellaneous
This is the entire agreement regarding Contributions, superseding any prior understandings.  
If any provision is held unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect.  
This Agreement may be updated prospectively by posting a revised version in the repository; submitting Contributions after such posting constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
