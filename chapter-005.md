The morning came softly, as though the world itself had turned from sorrow. Brenden stirred, slow and uncertain, beneath the weight of unfamiliar blankets. Light fell across him in long shafts, golden through the window-latch; he blinked, raising a hand to shield his eyes, and for a time lay still, listening.

The air was gentle, filled not with ash or smoke but with homely scents — the sweetness of fresh bread, the faint tang of clean timber, and the drift of oak-smoke from a fire burning somewhere nearby. From beyond the walls came the muffled rhythm of a world at peace: the creak of a barrow wheel, a call answered in the yard, the sharp ring of steel on wood. And above it all, heedless of grief, birds sang in the bright air.

For a while he did not move. The bed was soft beneath him, the linen cool against his skin, and he might almost have thought himself woken from a dream, had not the other bed at his side been empty, the coverlet turned back.

Memory returned like a flood. The snow-strewn path, the sudden riders. His father’s voice, unyielding. The clash of steel, the breaking of the ward. Fire, white and searing, bursting the night apart. His mother’s smile, fleeting, as she reached for the rune. The ruin, the circle of ash. And at the last, the fragment pressed against his breast — the fire sinking into him, the world fading to silence.

Brenden’s hand went to his chest. There was no scar, no wound to mark what had been. Yet beneath his palm he felt it: not pain, nor fever, but something stranger. A second heartbeat, quiet but insistent, pulsing within the rhythm of his own.

He lay there long, eyes fixed upon the rafters. At last a breath escaped him, low and heavy. He turned, swung his legs to the floor, and pressed his feet to the chill of the boards. The simple act cost him more will than he would have thought, yet it was done.

The hallway beyond was narrow and plain, the timber worn smooth by many years. He followed its length, each step measured, until he reached the wider room where the hearth was set. There the fire burned bright, flames licking steadily at blackened logs. In the chair nearest sat Mireth.

She looked smaller than he remembered, her cloak gathered close, her face pale with strain. The light caught upon her dark hair, loose from care, and her eyes were shadowed with sleeplessness. Yet when she turned at his step, she managed a faint curve of her mouth — not joy, but greeting.

“Good morning,” she said, her voice no louder than the crackle of the fire.

Brenden paused at the threshold, uncertain. At length he bowed his head. “Morning.” His throat was rough, the word ill-fitted. “How do you fare?”

“As one who lives, though not whole.” She shifted in her seat, a hand straying unconsciously to her side. Then her gaze steadied again. “And you?”

He gave no answer, for none seemed right. His silence held until another voice broke in.

“There you are!” Wenna’s call came from the far archway, brisk and warm. “Up at last. Come — the bread is cooling too fast as it is. You’ll have some while it’s fresh.”

The scent struck him anew, rich and homely, and with it a pang he could not name. He followed her into the kitchen, where the table was already laid with coarse cloth, crockery, and a round loaf split open, steam rising into the air. Butter lay in a small pot beside it, and eggs set firm and yellow upon a plate. Wenna pressed him into a seat, fussing in her quiet way, though her eyes lingered on him with motherly caution.

He ate because it was set before him. Each mouthful was warm, filling, and he felt strength creep back into his limbs, though his heart gave him little peace. The memory of ash clung to him, sharp as the smoke that never seemed to leave the air.

When at last the table was cleared, he returned to the hearth-room. Mireth had not moved far, though her posture had eased a little. Brenden drew up the other chair and sat across from her, the fire between them.

For a time they said nothing. The flames shifted, sending up sparks that flared and died. At length Mireth lifted her eyes.

“You showed courage,” she said. “You fought to get me here. Else I would have frozen in the dark, and been lost.”

Brenden shifted uneasily. “I only did what I could.”

Her gaze lingered, steady and grave. “And that was enough.”

The silence returned, heavy but not empty. Brenden stared at the fire until the words forced their way past his lips.

“Who were they?” His voice was low, unsteady. “My father. My mother. Who was the dark one that hunted them? What was the light that burned the night away? And this—” he pressed a hand to his breast, feeling the strange echo within “—what is it?”

Mireth did not answer at once. Her gaze fell, her fingers tightening on the arm of her chair. At length she drew a breath.

“There is more to be told than you can yet carry,” she said. “A lifetime would scarcely hold it all, and many nights would be needed even to begin the telling. I hardly know where to set the first stone, for the road behind us runs farther than you can dream.”

Her eyes lifted to his, steady and grave. “Yet you must hear something of it, else you will not understand what has come upon you. So I will tell what I can — and I will begin at the beginning.”

Mireth’s gaze drifted to the fire as though its flame might mirror another, older light. When she spoke, her voice was quiet, yet it carried a cadence unlike her common speech — the weight of words shaped by long remembrance.

“In the first days of memory,” she said, “the world was steeped in light. It was not as it is now, scattered and dim, but strong and near at hand, filling every field and hall, every brook and stone. Men and elves, dwarves and all other kindreds lived by its warmth, and peace was their portion. We call it the Age of Light, though in truth it was an age of many ages, for it endured longer than the count of two thousand years.”

Brenden listened, unmoving, his eyes upon her though he could scarce believe what he heard.

“Yet even then,” she went on, “the wise among the peoples knew it could not last. For every age wanes, and none are spared from change. Toward the end, the Enlightened — a circle of the greatest among all races, women and men of deep sight and true heart — saw that the shadows were lengthening. They foretold the passing of that bright age, and the coming of darkness after. But they would not see all light fade. They resolved to preserve a part of it, a seed to bear through the long night, so that when another dawn should come, it might find the world not wholly barren.”

She leaned forward, her eyes reflecting the fire’s glow. “So it was that the Light was gathered into stones. One hundred and eight gems, wrought not by hammer or spell, but by the union of their own lives with the Light itself. Each stone was called a Fragment, and each bore within it a spark of the great flame. The Enlightened pressed them to their hearts, and thus became more than they had been. They were the first Flamebound, keepers of the Light, and they went forth into the wide lands, to guard and to guide, to feed the earth and to shelter the peoples through the long decline.”

“They lived long after,” Mireth said, “longer than any mortal span had known before. Five centuries and more would pass for some, and still the fire within kept their strength from waning. Yet in the end even the Flamebound must bow to the road that all flesh must walk. When their time drew near, they sought another of good heart and steadfast spirit, and passed the Fragment to them. So the flame endured, one life to another, like a torch borne down a darkened road.

“In those first generations, all was well. The Flamebound held the lands against hunger and ruin, and even as the great Light dimmed in the world, a remnant was kept bright in their keeping. But no age holds forever to its height. After but two passages of succession, decline began.

“One among the keepers turned aside. His true name is lost, for none will speak it now, but he is remembered by the title he chose for himself — the Harp. At first his song was fair, and many listened. Yet little by little he wove shadows into his playing, and what was gentle became a snare. He set his will to dominion, not to service, and bent the flame within his heart to his own desire.

“Darkness grew in him, and he grew in darkness. He called to others, and some he swayed by guile, some he broke by force. Seventeen keepers were drawn into his shadow, and their light was turned. Where once they healed, they enslaved; where they fed the land, they bled it dry. Armies gathered under their hand, and their banners blackened the northeast. Thus began the first wars of the Flamebound — not of Light against Darkness only, but of kindred against kindred.”

Her voice faltered, though only a little, and she drew breath as though the remembering cost her. Brenden sat rigid in his chair, scarcely daring to move lest the spell of her words break.

“At last the loyal Flamebound made stand against them,” she said, lower now, her eyes far off. “They named themselves the Circle of Light, and they barred the path of the Harp’s armies upon the wide river called Elenrun, which men now call the River of Division. There they fought three days and nights, and though the Harp’s might was terrible, he could not break them. In the end he drew back, and the border was set. For fifteen centuries that line has held, sometimes in quiet, sometimes in fire and ruin, but never wholly broken.”

Mireth’s hands lay folded in her lap, but her knuckles were white. The firelight flickered across her face, showing weariness deep in her eyes. “Here in Brannock, you heard little of it. The wars are far, and the years between them long. Most folk think of them as tales for other lands. Yet they are no tale. The border holds still, though the Harp stirs ever in the dark.”

Brenden leaned forward, his breath caught, as though the world around him had shifted.Her eyes darkened again. “But the shadow is long, and the hunters of the Harp are patient. Among them, one has been named in dread whispers for centuries — Zireth. He was once as your father was, a keeper of the light. But he fell, and his fall was greater than most. He bent his flame wholly into darkness until his very form was marred, and long has he hunted the keepers, seeking their end. Few have faced him and lived. We knew he stalked the borderlands, that he would not rest until Eadric was found. Yet none of us thought he would dare come so deep into the heart of the Circle’s lands.”

The fire shifted, casting shadows high against the rafters. Mireth lowered her eyes, her voice quiet. “Yet he came. And now you know what his coming has wrought.”

For a moment she was silent, her hands folded tightly in her lap. Then she raised her head, and there was a harder light in her gaze. “But know this also: he paid dearly for that venture. Though we have lost, he has lost more. Zireth will trouble no one again. Whatever darkness drove him, it ended in your father’s fire. At the least, his shadow has passed from the world.”

Brenden sat back, as if the weight of her words had struck him bodily. The firelight blurred before his eyes, and his hand again strayed to his chest where the fragment lay hidden, beating its slow, insistent rhythm.

“The Circle endured,” Mireth said, her voice steadier now, though sorrow threaded each word. “For many lives of men, they held the border with their strength and their fragments. Generations rose and fell, but the flame did not falter. From the north came many wars, from the Harp’s host and from lesser kings who bent their knee to him. Yet the Circle withstood them, and among them some rose to great renown.

“One of these was your father, Eadric. He was of the fifth line since the first keepers, a bearer of the fragment for near three centuries. Few in our time surpassed him in the arts of war or the wisdom of command. It was under his hand that the Circle held firm in the War of the Black Fields, and again at the Siege of the White Gate. He did not merely wield the flame — he bore it with honor, turning battle to victory where defeat seemed certain. His name was a tower to our allies, and a dread to those who followed the Harp.”

Brenden’s heart thudded within him, a heavy echo against the strange second beat he had begun to feel. His father, who had mended fences and shouldered logs, who had spoken plain words and worked plain deeds — this same man had commanded armies in forgotten wars? He scarcely dared to breathe.

Mireth’s gaze softened, and for the first time since she began, her voice held a gentler tone. “Yet even the great grow weary. After long years of war, he laid aside the sword, and with Maela, your mother, he withdrew from the Circle’s councils. She too had borne her part — not as a bearer of flame, but as one gifted in healing and in arts of ward and rune. Together they chose the quiet life, hidden in this valley, so that their children might know peace, if only for a while.”

Her eyes darkened again. “But the shadow is long, and the hunters of the Harp are patient. Among them, one has been named in dread whispers for centuries — Zireth. He was once as your father was, a keeper of the light. But he fell, and his fall was greater than most. He bent his flame wholly into darkness until his very form was marred, and long has he hunted the keepers, seeking their end. Few have faced him and lived. We knew he stalked the borderlands, that he would not rest until Eadric was found. Yet none of us thought he would dare come so deep into the heart of the Circle’s lands.”

The fire shifted, casting shadows high against the rafters. Mireth lowered her eyes, her voice quiet. “Yet he came. And now you know what his coming has wrought.”

For a moment she was silent, her hands folded tightly in her lap. Then she raised her head, and there was a harder light in her gaze. “But know this also: he paid dearly for that venture. Though we have lost, he has lost more. Zireth will trouble no one again. Whatever darkness drove him, it ended in your father’s fire. At the least, his shadow has passed from the world.”

Brenden sat back, as if the weight of her words had struck him bodily. The firelight blurred before his eyes, and his hand again strayed to his chest where the fragment lay hidden, beating its slow, insistent rhythm.





Brenden sat back, as if the weight of her words had struck him bodily. The firelight blurred before his eyes, and his hand strayed once more to his breast where the fragment lay hidden, beating its slow, insistent rhythm.

Zireth, the hunter, was gone. The terror of whispered years had been broken. Yet the knowing brought him no triumph. His father’s fire had bought that end, his mother’s life had sealed it, and the ruin that marked the hill above was the price. The thought of it pressed hard upon him, until his breath came shallow and his vision clouded.

“They were not only my parents,” he said at last, his voice raw, “but something greater than I ever guessed. And yet to me… they were simply Father and Mother. How can both be true?”

Mireth did not answer at once. She watched the flames, her face grave and still. At length she said, “They bore greatness quietly, as the truest often do. To you they were father and mother, and so they would wish to be remembered. Yet to the Circle, they were a bulwark, and their passing is no small wound.”

The room settled into silence. Only the fire spoke, crackling softly as the wood split and fell inward. Outside, faint sounds of labor drifted in from the yard, the ordinary pulse of life carrying on, heedless of grief.

Brenden lowered his head into his hands. For a long time he sat thus, torn between memory and the strange new weight in his chest. At last he drew a long, shuddering breath and looked up.

“What am I to do with this?” His hand pressed once more against his breast. “This fire that is not mine, this burden that has fallen to me?”

Mireth’s eyes met his, steady though rimmed with weariness. “That, Brenden, is a question whose answer will not come in a day. What has been placed within you is greater than either of us can measure. But know this: it has come to you not by chance, but by need. In time, you will learn what it asks of you.”

Her words lingered between them, heavy as stone. Brenden gave no reply, but bowed his head once more, staring into the fire as though it might reveal some path.

So the telling ended, and night seemed to draw close about them once more, though the sun still shone outside and the birds still sang.
