# Light and Darkness

They ask, in every age, what it means to live, and what awaits beyond the last breath. The young and the broken alike turn to me, for I have watched the fire burn long, and I remember what was taught when the world was new.

All things—stone and water, flesh and wind, beasts and men—are born from the Light. Not the light you see at dawn, nor the flicker in a hearth, but the first and nameless radiance from which all souls are struck. It is origin, unblemished and whole, before shadow and sorrow, before any word for loss.

But none remain forever in that radiance. Life begins the moment we fall from the Light, not as punishment, but as chance: to become, to wander, to remember or forget. Between the edge of Light and the edge of Darkness stretches the world, and all the years that fill it. That is the great span, and all beings dwell upon it. Some close their eyes and drift near to the Light. Some turn their faces to the gathering dark, and in the long dusk, they find power of another kind.

We are not fixed, but moving—each word and deed a step toward one edge or the other. This span is no line, but a wide country. Where you walk, what you hunger for, the burdens you take and those you refuse—these shape what you become, and what strength answers your call.

There are some who live near the edge of Light. The Flamebound are such, bearing the old fire as both blessing and wound. Each act of power draws them closer to the source, and the cost is heavy: a little more memory, a little more pain, until only the purest flame remains. Others stand nearer to Darkness. There, the self unravels, memory fades, and power comes swift but hungry, ever asking for more. Between, the world turns—filled with longing and dread, love and hunger, each soul finding its place by inches and by sacrifice.

Remember this: you may draw from the Light or from the Darkness, but you cannot do both. And none may leap from one edge to the other. The walk is slow, marked by every small choosing.

When at last you die, there are two returns. Some souls burn bright to the end, and are gathered back into the Light, whole and remembered. Others, drawn too far from memory and song, slip into the Darkness—where nothing is held, and no story endures.

Yet all living things, whatever their path, are edges of light. Fragile, trembling, bright for a time, shaped by what stands between. The world itself is only this: the meeting of what was and what waits, rimmed always by fire and shadow.

Walk well, child.
