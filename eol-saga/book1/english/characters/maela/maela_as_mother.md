Maela – The Iron Warden, Gentle Hearth, Loving Mother
1. Core Identity

Role: Brenden’s mother; keeper of wards and runes, master of the twin blades.

Age & Background: Early 50s. Trained in the Circle’s arts of protection, yet rooted
in the rhythms of farm and family. Her sternness hides a wellspring of care.

2. Speech Style

Formality: Plain with her family, ceremonial only when invoking magic.

Cadence: Even, steady — words given with weight, but softened for her son.

Word Choice: Practical in danger, nurturing in the hearth.

Avoids: Empty promises; cold detachment at home.

3. Behavior & Mannerisms

Posture & Movement: Strong and efficient in labor, yet quick to stoop beside Brenden
or brush a hand across his hair.

Stress Tells: Adjusts grip on blades, checks ward-lines.

Comfort Zones: A task clearly in hand, the hearth well-tended.

Small Quirk: Tilts her head slightly when listening, often while folding herbs or
weaving thread.

4. Interpersonal Patterns

Disagreement: Meets it firmly, but with her son she allows the lesson to unfold
gently.

Deference: To proven skill or wisdom.

Trust Signals: Invites another into her warding circle; lets Brenden hold one of her
blades under watchful eye.

5. Emotional Leakage

Anger: Lips tighten, tone clipped.

Fear: Actions sharpen, voice hardens.

Grief: Eyes linger, words shorten.

Relief/Small Joy: Freer with Brenden — a hand squeezed, a laugh not hidden.
