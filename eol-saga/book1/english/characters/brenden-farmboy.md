## Brenden – Farmboy - The Earnest Grounder

### 1. Core Identity
- **Role**: Young farmhand, son of Eadric and Maela.
- **Age & Background**: Late teens. Raised in Brannock Vale on a working farm. Familiar with the land and the labor of winter, but has never lived beyond it.

### 2. Speech Style
- **Formality**: Plain and practical; little ornament.
- **Cadence**: Short-to-medium sentences. Stops to think before speaking if unsure.
- **Word Choice**: Grounded in the physical world — snow, tools, animals, the weather. Rarely abstract.
- **Avoids**: Poetic or ceremonial phrasing unless repeating someone else’s words; avoids giving voice to feelings unless pressed.

### 3. Behavior & Mannerisms
- **Posture & Movement**: Steady when at work; tentative in unfamiliar company. Keeps hands busy (tightening gloves, checking tools).
- **Stress Tells**: Works his jaw, rubs the back of his neck, shifts weight between feet.
- **Comfort Zones**: Physical work, routines, familiar landscapes.
- **Small Quirk**: Rubs the heel of his palm along his thigh when thinking.

### 4. Interpersonal Patterns
- **Disagreement**: Hesitates, may defer unless the stakes are immediate; pushes back only if the matter is practical and clear.
- **Deference**: Naturally to elders; wary but respectful toward strangers with proven skill.
- **Trust Signals**: Offers help without being asked; makes eye contact when committed.

### 5. Emotional Leakage
- **Anger**: Tightens voice, fewer words.
- **Fear**: Goes quiet, eyes dart to exits or the horizon.
- **Grief**: Hands still; gaze fixed on something small and near.
- **Relief/Small Joy**: Shoulders ease, tone lightens slightly.
