Chapter 1 Scaffold – Edges of Light
Section 1 – Morning on the Farm (≈1000 words)

Opening imagery: Winter dawn, snow still deep, frost at the windows, smoke rising from hearth.

Brenden’s chores:

Breaks ice in the well before drawing water.

Feeds mule, checks chicken coop, carries in firewood.

Breakfast scene:

Maela sets porridge on the table.

Light banter about sleeping late, waking to song or to Eadric’s boot.

Conversation meanders: chores for the day, small irritations, winter weariness.

Natural chewing, silence, and small gestures to show rhythm of family life.

Section 2 – Work in the Yard and Fields (≈800 words)

Father and son fence-mending:

Brenden helps Eadric mend a leaning post near the eastern pasture.

Conversation about tools, weather, patience in work.

Father’s stories of past winters in the Vale — nothing mythic, just real experience.

Characterization:

Eadric is respected, steady, willing to lend a hand to others.

Brenden restless, questions why things are done certain ways.

Mother indoors: loom work, herb sorting — glimpses, not focus.

Section 3 – Trip to the Village (≈1200 words)

Journey:

Mule harnessed to sledge; Brenden rides with Eadric down the track.

Winter countryside described (snowbanks, stream under ice, bare trees).

Village encounters:

Jorrin the smith: friendly with Eadric, banter about tools, winter troubles. Brenden listens, joins in with a question or two.

Tanna the weaver: warm greeting, teasing about Maela’s weaving, exchange of yarn or cloth.

General village life: smoke from chimneys, children running, carts creaking — the sense of lived place.

Tone: Eadric is well-regarded; everyone treats him with respect and ease.

Section 4 – Return & Quiet Evening (≈800 words)

Back at the farm: unloading, tending mule, storing supplies.

Simple supper: bread, broth, cheese substitute (since deep winter).

Fireside: Eadric carving a handle, Maela mending clothes, Brenden listening, asking questions, dozing off.

Atmosphere: quiet rhythm of family life, warmth of hearth against snow.

Section 5 – Aunt Mireth’s Visit (≈1000 words)

Arrival: A day or two later, sleigh bells or hoofbeats heard; Mireth comes riding in.

Characterization:

Familiar, beloved guest — once a month visits.

Older, sharp-witted, plainspoken.

She brings small gifts or gossip from further afield.

Meal together: warm and cheerful, conversation flows — she asks after Brenden’s chores, teases Eadric, compliments Maela’s cooking.

Evening stories: Mireth shares tales of nearby folk, perhaps a bit of lore in passing (not shard-related, not Flamebound).

Closing: Brenden goes to bed warm, safe, life simple and steady.

Narrative Goals

Tone: Innocent, homely, grounded. No tension, no myth yet.

Introduction: Farm, family, village, Aunt Mireth.
