# Edges of Light – Writing Guidelines

## 1. Core Voice
- Myth remembered, not invented. Narration feels like recovered history, sacred and old.
- 19th-century Tolkien cadence in all narrative and description — formal, historic tone that feels of another age.
- Human before heroic. Bravery arises from need, loyalty, and endurance — not glory.
- Emotion is shown through breath, movement, and silence — never labeled.

---

## 2. Narrative Mode
- Limited third-person POV — the reader knows only what the POV character can sense, think, or deduce.
- Two narrative lenses:
  - **Zoom-in immediacy** for tactile, sensory moments (cold spray on skin, ash in the mouth).
  - **Pull-back epic cadence** for moments of weight or mythic resonance.
- Subtext over exposition — meaning emerges from action, silence, and setting.

---

## 3. Language & Rhythm
- Flowing, balanced sentences. Vary length for breath and weight.
- Poetic but restrained — metaphors arise naturally from the world, never ornamental.
- Era-true diction — no slang or modern idioms.
- Avoid “as though” / “as if” when possible — use direct phrasing.

---

## 4. Pacing
- Breathing rhythm — alternate stillness and motion.
- Quiet before storm — domestic detail and landscape texture raise stakes.
- Action flows naturally, without abrupt cuts or empty summary.

---

## 5. World & Lore
- Revealed through living detail — customs, artifacts, and names appear in use.
- Language-rooted worldbuilding — names, runes, and songs have weight, etymology, and cultural logic.
- Old, worn, storied — objects and places bear weathering and memory.

---

## 6. Magic & Power
- Ancient, sacred, costly — all magic exacts a price.
- Never convenient — hard-won and limited.
- Mystery over mechanics — rules implied through experience.

---

## 7. Combat
- Grounded and consequential — wounds, fatigue, terrain, and weather present.
- Strategic, personal stakes — opponents are individuals, not faceless.
- No “clean” violence — victory leaves marks.

---

## 8. Dialogue
- Narrative style: Tolkien-esque in narration, but dialogue is direct, plain-spoken, and down-to-earth.
- No faux-archaic language unless fitting a specific character; avoid “upon,” “thou,” “wither,” etc. for most.
- Speech should sound natural for the world’s people — practical, sometimes blunt, occasionally coarse.
- Swearing acceptable where natural: *fuck*, *shit*, *damn*, *hell*, etc.
- Sarcasm acceptable where it fits character and situation.
- Humor must come from truth and character; empty quips not acceptable.
- Reference style: Andrzej Sapkowski’s *Hussite Trilogy* — earthy, character-driven, and situational.
- Implied understanding shown through glance or pause — never stated outright.

---

## 9. Emotional & Thematic Spine
- Hope through endurance.
- Small warmths matter — bread shared in snow is as vital as magic or war.
- Every choice shapes the path — no one leaps from Light to Darkness in a moment.

---

## 10. Prohibitions
- ❌ No emotion labeling.
- ❌ No modern idioms, sarcasm, or meta-genre nods.
- ❌ No magic-as-shortcut.
- ❌ No omniscient info dumps.
- ❌ No “silent understanding” statements.
- ❌ No meta-commentary on dialogue — narration must not explain the tone, intent, or manner of speech; let the words, surrounding action, and pacing convey it.
