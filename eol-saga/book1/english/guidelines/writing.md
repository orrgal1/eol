# Edges of Light – Writing Guidelines

## 1. Core Voice
- Myth remembered, not invented. Narration feels like recovered history,
  sacred and old.
- 19th-century Tolkien cadence in all narrative and description — formal,
  historic tone that feels of another age.
- Human before heroic. Bravery arises from need, loyalty, and endurance —
  not glory.
- Emotion is shown through breath, movement, and silence — never labeled.

---

## 2. Narrative Mode
- Limited third-person POV — the reader knows only what the POV character
  can sense, think, or deduce.
- Two narrative lenses:
  - **Zoom-in immediacy** for tactile, sensory moments (cold spray on skin,
    ash in the mouth).
  - **Pull-back epic cadence** for moments of weight or mythic resonance.
- Subtext over exposition — meaning emerges from action, silence, and
  setting.
- Avoid meta-commentary about what expressions or gestures "know" or "mean" - show actions directly. 
- Once in a character's POV, use pronouns rather than repeatedly naming them.
- In general avoid repeating the same reference to a character over and over in sequence.

---

## 3. Language & Rhythm
- Flowing, balanced sentences. Vary length for breath and weight.
- Poetic but restrained — metaphors arise naturally from the world, never
  ornamental.
- Era-true diction — no slang or modern idioms.
- Avoid empty simlies when possible — use direct phrasing.
- Avoid tell-tale AI giveaways in rhythm and punctuation: overuse of
  em-dashes, mechanically uniform sentence lengths, repetitive clause
  scaffolds, or overly tidy parallelism. Prefer clear commas and periods;
  use dashes and ellipses sparingly and only when earned.
- Punctuation should feel hand-made and breathable, not machine-even.

---

## 4. Pacing
- Breathing rhythm — alternate stillness and motion.
- Quiet before storm — domestic detail and landscape texture raise stakes.
- Action flows naturally, without abrupt cuts or empty summary.

---

## 5. World & Lore
- Revealed through living detail — customs, artifacts, and names appear in
  use.
- Language-rooted worldbuilding — names, runes, and songs have weight,
  etymology, and cultural logic.
- Old, worn, storied — objects and places bear weathering and memory.

---

## 6. Magic & Power
- Ancient, sacred, costly — all magic exacts a price.
- Never convenient — hard-won and limited.
- Mystery over mechanics — rules implied through experience.

---

## 7. Combat
- Grounded and consequential — wounds, fatigue, terrain, and weather
  present.
- Strategic, personal stakes — opponents are individuals, not faceless.
- No “clean” violence — victory leaves marks.

---

## 8. Dialogue
- Narrative style: Tolkien-esque in narration; dialogue is direct,
  plain-spoken, and down-to-earth.
- No faux-archaic language unless fitting a specific character; avoid
  “upon,” “thou,” “wither,” etc. for most speakers.
- Speech should sound natural for the world’s people — practical, sometimes
  blunt, occasionally coarse.
- Swearing acceptable where natural: *fuck*, *shit*, *damn*, *hell*, etc.
- Sarcasm acceptable where it fits character and situation. Humor must arise
  from truth and character; no empty quips.
- Natural rhythm over “symbolic” lines. Allow pauses, false starts,
  interjections, and self-corrections (e.g., “oh,” “uhh,” “well,” “hmm”)
  where appropriate — without overuse.
- Lines may trail off, be interrupted, or revise mid-thought; not every
  sentence must land perfectly.
- Use action beats and silence to carry subtext; avoid ping-pong exchanges.
- Implied understanding is shown through glance or pause — never stated
  outright.
- Conversations must always flow naturally — never choppy, mechanical, or
  symbolic. Real people are usually much more verbose than it takes to get a message across. They are rarely conscise. They pause, reflect, think out load, backtrack, etc.
- Avoid empty humor or overly clever turns of phrase in everyday speech.

---

## 9. Emotional & Thematic Spine
- Hope through endurance.
- Small warmths matter — bread shared in snow is as vital as magic or war.
- Every choice shapes the path — no one leaps from Light to Darkness in a
  moment.

---

## 10. Prohibitions
- ❌ No emotion labeling.
- ❌ No modern idioms or meta-genre nods.
- ❌ No magic-as-shortcut.
- ❌ No omniscient info dumps.
- ❌ No “silent understanding” statements.
- ❌ No meta-commentary on dialogue — narration must not explain tone,
  intent, or manner of speech; let words, action, and pacing convey it.
- ❌ No fillers or abstractions where characters can actually live the
  event.
- ❌ No AI giveaways: overuse of em-dashes, mechanically even cadences,
  templated beats, or copy-paste sentence frames.

---

## 11. Formatting (for story outputs)
- Deliver story text in valid Markdown (`.md`).
- Headings may be used sparingly to structure larger sections; within
  scenes, prefer continuous narrative flow.
- Bold and italic may be used sparingly for emphasis.
- Do **not** use lists or code blocks in narrative or dialogue.
- Break text into readable line lengths (≈80 characters or less) so it can
  be viewed on screen without sideways scrolling.
- Section separators (e.g. `---`) may be used inside chapters to mark a
  clear break between scenes. These should be rare and purposeful, not used
  as a substitute for natural narrative transitions.
