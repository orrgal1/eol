# Lowfield Farm in Winter

## Overview
The Lowfield farm stands at the edge of the valley, a modest holding sustained by steady work and family effort. It consists of a main dwelling, several outbuildings, and surrounding fields and orchards. In winter the farm is defined by snowbound ground, shortened days, and the reliance on stored provisions.

## Layout
- **Main House**  
  A low, rectangular structure of timber and stone with a thatched roof, often burdened by snow. The interior is centered around a large hearth that provides heat and light during the long nights. Small sleeping chambers open off the main space. Floors are covered with simple woven rugs, and shelves hold jars of preserved foods, dried herbs, and tools for daily use.

- **Outbuildings**  
  - **Barn**: Shelter for livestock through the cold season, filled with hay and bedding to keep animals alive through winter.  
  - **Work Shed**: Holds farm tools and implements, many set aside until spring.  
  - **Grain Store**: A raised structure protecting sacks of grain and root vegetables from frost and vermin.  

- **Yard and Fields**  
  The yard is hard-frozen, layered with snow and ice where paths are trampled. The surrounding fields lie fallow, their ridges hidden beneath frost. The small orchard of apple trees is bare, branches dark against the pale sky. Fence lines are half-buried under drifts.

## Atmosphere
In winter the farm is stark and quiet, its rhythm slowed to the needs of survival. Smoke from the hearth marks life within, while outside the land lies hushed and still beneath snow. Work centers on tending animals, managing stores, and enduring the cold.

## Role
Lowfield Farm represents the daily life of its family and serves as a fixed point in the wider landscape, even when winter reduces the fields to silence and the family to their hearth.
