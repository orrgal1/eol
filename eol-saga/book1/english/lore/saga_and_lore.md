# General Saga & Lore Sheet – *Edges of Light*

## Core Themes
- **Myth Remembered**: The world carries the weight of ancient struggles. What was broken long ago still echoes in the present.  
- **Light and Shadow**: Every choice leans toward hope or despair; even ordinary folk bear the burden of this balance.  
- **Human Before Heroic**: Characters are bound first by kinship, love, and duty; greatness comes only after loss and endurance.  
- **Cost of Power**: Magic and strength are never free. Every gift exacts its due, whether in blood, years, or spirit.

## Cosmology
- **The Flame (Caldrith)**:  
  - Once a primal source of life and renewal.  
  - Shattered into 108 shards to keep it from the Harp’s corruption.  
  - Shards can bind to chosen bearers — rare, perilous, and not always survivable.  
- **The Harp**:  
  - A cleric turned betrayer, who sought to claim Caldrith’s light for dominion.  
  - Imprisoned by the first Flamebound, freed in weakened form a year before saga begins.  
- **The Flamebound**:  
  - Those who survived binding a shard to their heart.  
  - Gain extended life, physical strength, and access to primordial magic.  
  - Bear secrecy and are hunted by the Harp’s order.  
- **The Circle of Light**:  
  - Stewards of lore and guardians of shards.  
  - Not all are Flamebound; many serve through knowledge, healing, or vigilance.

## The World
- **The Vale**:  
  - A small, sheltered valley — Brenden’s home.  
  - Known for its quiet farms, a close-knit village, and seasons marked by toil.  
- **The Wider Lands**:  
  - Forests, highlands, rivers, and distant cities, each touched differently by the Harp’s return.  
  - Some lands fall to shadow, others hold to fragile peace.  
- **Folk & Creatures**:  
  - Humans are the heart of the tale, though hints of older races linger (giants, orc-kin, spirits in wild places).  
  - Most people in the Vale know little of these, living ordinary rural lives.

- **Everyday Life as Sacred**: Simple meals, farm work, winter tasks matter as much as battles.  
- **Violence is Never Clean**: Struggle is harsh, wounds real, and death lingers.  
- **Dialogue Grounded**: Characters speak plainly, with warmth, humor, or roughness — never stiff or symbolic.  
- **Mythic Cadence**: Narration draws from old chronicles, yet focused through lived human eyes.

- **Continuing Telling**
