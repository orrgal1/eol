# Chapter 1: Peace

Winter lay close upon the ridge, packing the pines with white and holding
its breath in the thickets. The air had that keen stillness that makes
small sounds run far—a jay's cry sharp as breaking glass, the creak of
laden boughs, the soft collapse of snow sliding from needle to ground.
Brenden crouched with one knee pressed into the crust, bow set, the
string thrumming faintly between his gloved fingers. The leather had
worn thin at the tips where he drew, and he could feel the cold through
it, patient and waiting. Beside him, Eadric waited without a word, eyes
on the opening where the deer would pass if the wind held true.

A red shape slid between the dark trunks, head bowed to nose at a
crusted clump of frozen ivy. It was a young buck, two winters perhaps,
lean from the cold months but not starved. Its breath steamed in small
puffs as it worked at the ivy, ears swiveling though its attention stayed
low. Brenden raised the bow until the fletchings brushed his cheek, the
familiar scratch of goose feather against stubble. His breath came sharp
in the iron air, and he held it, feeling his heartbeat settle into the
spaces between seconds. The wood creaked faintly as he drew to full span.
He let the breath run out slow through his teeth, steadied on the crease
behind the shoulder, and loosed.

The deer lurched, snow bursting from its flank, and sprang away into the
pale birches with that particular violence of wounded things. The arrow
had taken it too far back—he knew it the instant the string sang forward.
Branches flung down their burdens of white, a cascade that hissed and
settled. Then the forest gathered the sound back into itself, until only
the hush of falling flakes remained, vast and patient as the world's own
breathing.

Brenden held still a heartbeat longer, watching the place where the deer
had vanished. The string still hummed its ghost-note in the air. He
lowered the bow and listened. Nothing but the slow settling of disturbed
snow, a raven's far cry, and somewhere distant the crack of wood
adjusting to cold. He glanced toward his father, already knowing what
he would see.

Eadric's gaze stayed on the line of trees, reading something in the
middle distance that Brenden could not yet parse. The older man's beard
had gathered frost at its edges, and his breath came in measured clouds.
He nodded once, the motion small as a branch dipping. "Good draw. Clean
release."

"Too far back," Brenden said, jaw tight. "I was aiming for the heart,
but—" He stopped, worked his mouth, started again. "The string jumped
under my glove when I loosed. Or maybe... hell, maybe the beast just
shifted. My stance might have slipped on the crust too." He had aimed
for the shoulder's sweet spot, that narrow window to the heart, but the
arrow had struck behind the ribs instead. He pictured the shaft's path
through the body—through muscle and lung, perhaps catching the liver,
cruel but not quick. The deer would run hard yet, bleeding inside,
drowning in its own breath. His jaw worked as he checked the second
arrow, running his thumb along the fletching to feel for damage.

Eadric stood with the particular economy of movement that comes from
decades of rising from snow, and shook the white from his cloak. The
heavy wool swung and settled. "Well then. Think you can follow his
path?"

Brenden lifted his chin, though doubt sat cold in his stomach. "I can."

"Then lead on. And mind your breathing—it tells more than you think."

They moved into the birches, Brenden first, learning the shape of his
mistake with each step. The mark was easy at first: small dark spots
against the crust, each the size of a copper coin, edges already
crystallizing in the cold. A brushed twig here, white bark scraped to
green. A broken fern crushed beneath a sharp hoof-splay, the stems
snapped clean. The prints cut uphill, which surprised him—wounded
things usually seek low ground, thick cover. But this one angled along
a drift where the wind had scoured the snow to ice, perhaps seeking
harder ground where the blood would not mark so clearly.

Eadric let the boy lead, following with that peculiar silence that made
him seem to weigh nothing despite his broad frame. Only occasionally did
snow whisper beneath his boots, and then so softly it might have been
wind-shift.

Brenden hesitated where the prints grew faint, the blood thinning to
mere suggestions of color. The trail forked around a massive oak, and
he could not tell which way the beast had chosen. He crouched, studying
the ground, feeling his father's patient presence behind him like warmth
from a banked fire.

"How do you know it climbed rather than doubled back?" he asked finally,
hating the admission in the question.

"That fir there." Eadric moved up beside him, pointing with his chin
rather than his hand. "See the rime brushed from the lower bough? Height
of a deer's belly. And look—" He indicated the blood pattern with a
small gesture. "The drops thin and elongate where it leaned into the
slope. Means it's slowing, working harder. We keep our pace steady and
our breathing easy. Let it tire while we stay fresh."

Brenden crouched and touched one of the drops with his fingertip. The
blood had already crusted at its edges, and no steam rose from it. He
wiped his finger on the hem of his glove—a boy's gesture he immediately
regretted—and pressed on. The trail told its story in small scripts: a
hare had crossed their path, the neat prints like punctures in good
paper, unconcerned with the larger drama. Farther on, a fox had traced
the edge of a drift, investigated something beneath a log, and turned
aside where the wind shifted to carry some new scent.

They crossed a stand of young spruce, the needles so laden with ice they
looked cast in glass, catching what light filtered through the overcast
and throwing it back in subtle fire. Past that, the land folded into a
shallow dell where older trees made a kind of cathedral, their trunks
rising like dark pillars from the white floor. The track sharpened there,
blood bright again, the hoof-marks beginning to drag rather than lift
clean. The deer had crashed through a thicket of winter bramble, leaving
broken canes and a scatter of old berries, wizened to black leather.

Brenden slowed, something shifting in his chest. The air felt different
here—thicker, waiting.

"Closer now," Eadric murmured, so soft it might have been thought rather
than spoken. "Listen with your feet."

Brenden knew the phrase from smaller hunts near the hedge-bounded fields
of home. To listen with one's feet was to feel the ground's reply to
your weight—the crack of too-thin crust that would give you away, the
silence where moss held your step in secret, the hollow drum beneath
roots that might amplify your passage. He let his boots choose the
quieter places, rolling his weight from heel to toe where the earth gave
soft answer. His breath ran shallow and careful. The dell folded deeper,
the trees pressing close, and in that gathering darkness something moved
that was not deer-light but heavier, lower, a shadow with substance and
intent.

He raised his hand, fingers spread. Behind him, Eadric's step stopped as
surely as if Brenden had reached back and pressed his chest.

The deer lay twenty paces ahead, down but not dead, its chest working in
sharp, shallow pulls that lifted little clouds of steam. The arrow stood
from its flank at an ugly angle, fletching dark with blood. But what
held Brenden's eye was the wolf standing over it. A male, winter-lean,
ribs showing like barrel staves beneath a coat gone gray with hunger. Its
eyes burned like coals in ash, and its jaws were already pinked from
where it had begun to feed, taking the soft parts first while the deer
still breathed. The growl it gave was not loud, but it carried through
the dell's hollow, low and heavy, a sound that seemed to rise from the
earth itself.

Brenden's fingers found the bow's grip and tightened. He began to draw,
slow and smooth, thinking to put an arrow through the wolf's chest, to
claim what was theirs by right of first blood. But Eadric's palm touched
the bow's curve and pressed it gently down.

"No," his father said, and stepped past him.

Eadric walked forward. Not fast, not aggressive, but with the steady
purpose of a man entering his own barn. He did not shout or wave his
arms or throw stones as Brenden had seen other men do with wolves. He
simply walked, shoulders square, eyes level, as if the wolf were not
there at all, as if he meant to walk through the space it occupied. His
hands hung empty at his sides. His breath misted in slow, even clouds.

The wolf's ears flicked forward, then back. It lowered its head and
shifted its weight to its haunches, ready to spring. Its lips pulled back
to show teeth yellow as old bone. The growl deepened, became something
felt in the chest as much as heard.

The space between them closed to three spans, then two. Eadric did not
slow. He looked not at the wolf's eyes or teeth but through it, the way
a man looks past a gate he means to walk through, past a tree that
stands in his chosen path. Step by step he claimed the ground, each
footfall deliberate as a sealed letter.

The wolf's snarl rose to something almost like confusion. It shifted its
weight from paw to paw, the snow creaking beneath it. Its head turned
aside as if to look for other threats, then snapped back to Eadric.
Another step. The man could have reached out and touched the gray ruff.
Another step, and he would have to push the wolf aside to continue.

The wolf broke. Not in fear—Brenden could see that—but in something like
recognition. It gave ground, one pace, then three, backing with stiff
legs and a continuous rumble of displeasure. At the edge of the clearing
it paused, held Eadric's gaze for a long moment that carried its own
language, then slipped between two firs and was gone, silent as smoke
on water.

Only when the trees had stilled completely, when even the memory of the
wolf's presence had faded, did Eadric turn his head back to his son.
"Your arrow," he said, holding out his hand.

Brenden fumbled it from the quiver, noticed his fingers trembling, and
steadied them with will. He placed the arrow in his father's palm.

The deer on the ground shuddered, tried once to lift its head, and
failed. Eadric knelt in one motion, set the arrow's point to the soft
place below the jaw where thought lives, and pushed. Quick and clean, the
small violence that ends larger violence. The deer's eye, which had been
rolling white with fear, went still and deep as winter pools. Eadric
rested a palm on the warm hide after, neither triumph nor sorrow in the
gesture, just acknowledgment. Then he rose, knees popping slightly in
the cold.

"Your knife," Brenden said, already working the loop free from his belt.
He was proud that his voice came steady.

They opened the deer in the old way, Eadric guiding Brenden's hands when
they hesitated. First the long cut from breast to belly, careful not to
puncture the stomach. Then the delicate work of separating hide from
flesh without tearing either. Steam rose from the opened body, turning
the air briefly warm and strange with the smell of blood and organ-meat.
Brenden's gorge rose once, and he turned his head to breathe cold air,
then returned to the work. Eadric showed him how to reach deep and cut
the windpipe free, how to roll the mass of organs out onto the snow in
one piece, how to joint the legs for easier carrying.

"See here," Eadric said, pointing to where Brenden's arrow had passed.
"Through the liver's edge and the lung. He would have died, but not
quickly. The wolf might have been kinder."

They worked in the growing cold of afternoon, their breath making a fog
around their hands. Ravens had already found them, dropping from branch
to branch with sidewise hops and pragmatic patience. One cocked its head
and made a sound like a question.

"Soon, grandfather," Eadric said to it without looking up. "We leave you
the soft parts."

When the quarters were wrapped in the canvas they'd brought, they left
the organs in a neat pile beneath the fir. The head too, eyes clouded
now with frost. "It keeps the peace," Eadric said, seeing Brenden's
look. "They have their hunger. We have our need. No sense robbing the
woods of more than feeds us. That wolf will be back before our boot
prints fade, and the ravens will have their portion, and the small things
that come after will have theirs. By spring you won't find a bone."

They bundled the meat tight and began the carry down the slope. At the
lower track where they'd left the rough sled beneath a concealing spruce,
they loaded the quarters and tied them down with rope that had seen
twenty winters of such work. The runners squealed in protest as they
started, then found their voice and sang across the crust. Brenden took
the rope over his shoulder and leaned into the pull. His father steadied
from behind where the slope wanted to send the whole business tumbling.

The trees thinned as they descended, opening to show the Hallow Vale
spread below like a map of itself. Fields sleeping under white, the
snake-curve of hedgerows marking boundaries older than memory. The
village to the west was just a suggestion of smoke threads rising
straight in the still air. To the south, the gap in the hills opened
toward the lower countries, where Brenden had never been but about which
he'd heard tales—roads that ran for days without a hill, towns where
more people lived than he'd met in his whole life. The wind shifted and
brought the smell of home: frost-dried straw, woodsmoke, the faint
sweet rot of apples left for the deer.

"What would you have done if the wolf had stood?" Brenden asked after
they'd found a rhythm, not looking back, letting the question fall casual
as dropped wood.

Eadric was quiet long enough that Brenden thought he might not answer.
Then: "Much the same. Only it would have taken longer. And I might have
had to bleed for it."

"You've done it before."

"Once. When you were still at the breast. A hard winter, that one. The
wolf was a mother with pups denned somewhere close. Hungry enough to be
stupid about it." He paused. "She took some convincing."

"Did she hurt you?"

"Some. Your mother stitched me after. Said I was lucky to keep all my
fingers." Another pause. "The wolf lived. Saw her the next winter, teaching
her young to hunt mice in the barn meadow. We watched each other a
while, then went our ways."

They came down through the last birches, their trunks running like pale
bars against the darker woods behind. The old cart track took them in,
ruts frozen hard enough to turn an ankle if you stepped careless. Their
mule waited where they'd left him, head low, one hip cocked in the way
of patient animals. His ears swiveled at their approach, and he shook
his shaggy neck as if to say he'd had enough of standing about in the
cold, thank you very much.

"Thistle," Brenden said, rubbing the gray nose. "There's work at last,
you lazy thing."

The mule snorted, spraying Brenden with hay-scented moisture, and
submitted to being hitched to the sled. They made the last half-mile
easy, following the farm track between the home fields. The boundary
stones stood up from the snow like old teeth, marking where their land
began. A fox had been hunting mice along the wall—the delicate prints
and occasional plunge-marks told that story clearly enough.

The farm came into view by degrees, revealing itself like a tale told
in familiar words. First the orchard, all bones and angles against the
sky, each twig edged in white like careful artwork. Then the low barn
with its roof bowed under snow, the weight of it making the beams creak
in the wind. Then the stone house itself, built by Eadric's father's
father from rocks cleared from these very fields, mortared with clay
from the streambed, roofed with slate from the quarry two valleys over.
Smoke rose steady from the chimney, straight as a plumb line in the
still air. The woodpile under its lean-to on the north wall stood tall
yet—they'd cut extra in autumn, feeling the early cold in their bones.
The chicken coop wore a fringe of icicles like an old woman's decorated
hat. The well stones shone with rime, and the rope was stiff as iron
when Brenden brushed it in passing.

They drew up in the yard. Brenden worked at the frozen knots while
Eadric lifted the bar on the barn door, the wood groaning as it swung.
Inside, the air hung warm and thick with the smell of hay and animals,
almost shocking after the knife-edge cold outside. Thistle's stall was
clean—Maela had mucked it while they were gone, the fresh straw golden
in the dim light. They hung the meat quarters from the high beams,
beyond the reach of anything that might come calling in the night, and
set an old pot beneath to catch the drip.

"We'll salt it come morning," Eadric said, testing the rope one more
time. "Take the wild edge off the taste and keep it sweet when the
weather turns. Though if this cold holds, we could hang it a week and
it wouldn't spoil."

He wiped his hands on his trousers, a gesture so automatic Brenden
doubted he knew he did it, and looked toward the house. Yellow light
showed warm at the window, and Brenden could see his mother's shadow
moving past. "Bring the sled to the lee side," Eadric said. "No sense
letting it fill with snow if the wind turns. I'll see to getting us in
before she bars the door against the cold."

Brenden dragged the sled under the eaves where the roof would shelter it,
tipped it against the wall, and kicked the runners clear of frozen mud.
His toes had gone numb in his boots, and he stamped feeling back into
them at the threshold, watching how his breath hung in the air like a
living thing before dissolving.

The heat hit him as he pushed through the door, thick and sweet with
bread and stewing meat. The room seemed almost too bright after the
forest's darkness, the fire throwing wild shadows that danced on the
walls. Maela stood by the hearth with a long spoon in hand, stirring
something that bubbled and popped. Her sleeves were rolled past the
elbow, showing forearms strong from years of kneading and churning. A
strand of dark hair had escaped her braid and hung by her cheek, moving
slightly with her breath. She looked up at his entrance, took in the
state of him with that quick catalogue mothers make—hands raw from
rope work, face wind-burned to leather, ice beading on his cloak,
blood dried brown on his gloves—and set the spoon down with a
small click against the pot's rim.

"Here now," she said, voice gentle but broking no argument. "Warm water
for those hands before anything else. I won't have you losing fingers to
the cold, not when there's wood yet to split before spring."

She was already moving, efficient as always, pouring from the kettle
she kept at the fire's edge. Eadric entered behind Brenden, pulled the
door firm against its swollen frame, and hung his cloak on its usual peg.
Ice fell from it to puddle on the floor. He waited while Maela set the
basin on the bench, steam rising like a blessing.

Brenden held his hands over the vapor first, feeling the pain that meant
blood was moving again. Then, slowly, he lowered them into the water. The
ache was immediate and profound, running up his arms like lightning.

"Gods' blood," he muttered, then caught his mother's eye. "Sorry."

"I've heard worse from your father when he hits his thumb with the
hammer," she said, but her mouth quirked in what might have been
amusement. "Turn them over. Let the heat reach both sides."

When the worst of the pain had passed and his fingers would bend again,
she handed each a rough cloth. "Dry well. The stew won't improve with
waiting, and I'll not hear complaints if it's overcooked."

They sat at the table in their accustomed places. The bowls were thick
clay, made by the potter in the village who'd had one eye and clever
hands before the fever took him last winter. The spoons were older still,
carved from horn, smooth from use. Maela served without ceremony—barley
gone soft with cooking, turnips from the root cellar, carrots wintered
sweet, onions that had kept well in their braids, and a good piece of
salt pork for richness. She set the bread board between them, the loaf
still warm enough to steam when torn, and a crock of butter that had
been churned when the last grass was green and held that memory in its
taste.

"Eat first," she said when Eadric began to speak. "The tale will keep."

They ate with focus, the only sounds the scrape of spoon on clay and the
fire's occasional comment. The bread soaked up the stew's broth, and the
butter melted into golden pools. Brenden hadn't realized how hungry he
was until the first spoonful hit his stomach, and then he could have
eaten the pot entire.

When the first edge of hunger had been dulled, Maela looked toward
Eadric. "Well then. Tell it."

"Arrow took him behind the ribs," Eadric said, tearing another piece of
bread with deliberate care. "Ran uphill, which was odd. Found him in the
dell beyond the spruce stand. A wolf had come to claim the ending of it."

Maela's hands stilled on the rim of her bowl, though her face didn't
change. "Alone?"

"A young male. Lean as a stick. Winter's been hard on more than just us."
He paused, considered. "I asked him to find his meal elsewhere."

"Asked," she repeated, and now there was definitely something dry in her
tone. "And he listened to your asking?"

"After some discussion."

She looked at him long, reading things in his face that Brenden couldn't
see. Then she turned to study Brenden's hands where they wrapped around
his bowl. "No hurts?"

"None worth naming," Brenden said. He flexed his fingers to prove it,
though the left knuckle twinged where he'd scraped it on tree bark. "He
showed me how to joint the quarters proper. How to work with the grain
of the meat, not against it."

Maela's expression softened, the worry lines around her eyes easing.
"Good." She studied his hands a moment longer, as if she could see
through skin to bone, then nodded to herself. "Your grandfather took a
finger to frostbite the year you were born. Said he didn't miss it much,
but I caught him trying to hold a chisel come spring and cursing the
loss." She took up a piece of bread, broke it with careful hands, and
passed half to Brenden. It wasn't a question. He took it and
spread it thick with butter that caught the firelight like gold.

They ate in companionable quiet for a time. The wind tested the shutters
once, rattling them in their frames, then thought better of it. A log
shifted in the fire, sending up a small constellation of sparks.

"Mireth should be through tomorrow if the track holds," Maela said finally,
setting her spoon aside with the small click of horn on wood. "She'll be
making her rounds, same as every winter. Probably stopping at every farm
between here and the bridge, knowing her." She rose to check the shelf
by the door. "I've put a loaf aside for her, and there's dried apples
from the loft. She was partial to them last time."

Eadric nodded, scraping the last of his stew. "About her time, isn't it?
Month past the first real snow, same as always."

"Twenty years she's been riding this route," Maela said. "Never missed
a winter yet, not even that year the drifts were higher than the fence
posts."

Brenden looked up from his bowl. "What news do you think she'll bring?"

Maela lifted the cloth from her lap, folded it with precise movements,
and laid it flat on the table. Her fingers smoothed the creases. "Oh,
the usual winter's worth. She'll have seen how the bridges stand at
Miller's Crossing, whether that last flood took them or they held. Who
wintered in the high farms and who came down to the village early. What
they're asking for rye in the river towns, and whether the wool merchants
will come this far come spring." She paused, and a small smile touched
her mouth. "And she'll have tales that aren't about trade at all, knowing
her. Stories from the south roads. Songs, maybe, if we're lucky and she's
had enough wine to loose her tongue."

"She always brings enough talk to fill three evenings, never mind one,"
Eadric said. There was fondness in it, though he tried to sound gruff.
"Last winter it was that business about the merchant who tried to sell
glass as gemstone. Took her half the night to tell it proper, with all
the voices."

Maela's eyes warmed with memory. "She does tell a story well." Her gaze
drifted to the fire, watching something in the flames that wasn't there.
"It will be good to hear her voice again. Good to hear any voice that's
traveled farther than the village well."

She rose then, businesslike, and set another ladle of stew in Eadric's
bowl despite his raised hand. "You'll need the strength come morning.
That meat won't salt itself, and there's still the matter of the
woodpile. I won't have you waking with your stomach growling like that
wolf of yours."

"Wasn't my wolf," Eadric muttered, but he took up his spoon again.

They finished without hurry. The room had filled with that particular
contentment that comes after hard work and hot food. When the bowls were
stacked and the bread wrapped in its cloth, Eadric rose to check the door
bar and bank the fire for the night. He moved the logs with practiced
efficiency, building the careful structure that would hold heat till dawn.
Maela rinsed the basin with water from the kettle, hung the cloths on
their pegs to dry. She paused by Brenden's chair and laid her hand on
his shoulder, fingers warm through his shirt. She didn't speak, but the
touch said what words wouldn't: pride, worry, love, all twisted together
like good rope.

"Up with you," she said finally, the moment passing. "Sleep while the
wind's quiet. Tomorrow brings what it brings."

Brenden climbed the ladder to the loft, each rung familiar as his own
name. The third one creaked—it always had—and the seventh was smooth
where years of hands had worn it. The loft air hung cold and still,
smelling of the herbs Maela dried from the rafters and the old wood of
the house itself. His narrow cot waited in its corner, the straw tick
rustling as he settled into it. He pulled the wool blankets to his chin,
feeling the day's cold finally releasing its grip on his bones.

Below, he heard the small sounds of the house settling into night:
Eadric's heavy tread, the scrape of the bench being pushed under the
table, Maela's lighter step as she made her final round. The fire popped
once, sharp as a breaking branch. Wind touched the roof, a whisper that
ran the length of the house and away.

Brenden thought about the wolf's eyes, that moment when it had looked
through his father at something else, something older than farms and
fences. He thought about the deer's last breath, how it had sounded
almost like relief. He thought about his mother's hand on his shoulder,
the weight of it, the promise.

Sleep took him between one thought and the next, deep and dreamless as
winter earth.
