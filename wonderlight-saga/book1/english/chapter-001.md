# Ch. 1: The Pond That Waited

The Greenwood was never the same twice.

Paths that yesterday ran straight as ribbons had learned new curves overnight. Ferns that had been no higher than a child’s knee rose suddenly to the shoulders, crowding together as if to share a secret. Even the light behaved strangely in that forest—slipping between leaves, pooling on moss, and then, when it had played enough, vanishing entirely as though it had never been.

On the morning our story begins, the Greenwood woke in a gentle mood. The sky (what little of it could be seen) was a soft, milk-blue, and the air carried the kind of warmth that gets into your bones and makes you hum under your breath without quite knowing why. Bees hummed too, which is only fair, and a thrush kept repeating a question to anyone who would listen: *You there? You there? You—there?*

Noam, Danielle, and Yonatan were indeed there, though they were meant to be only as far as the blackberry thickets on the near edge of the trees. They had a basket between them and a mother’s words in their ears: “Back by noon, and wash your hands this time. Blackberry stains are not the same as freckles, Danielle.”

“I never said they were,” Danielle replied then, which was true, though she had not promised to wash either.

Noam had been the first to notice that the Greenwood felt extra awake. She had said so, laughing as a breeze spilled a handful of white petals into her curls. The laugh tinkled; the petals twirled; and three pale lilies woke in the shadow of the berry brambles with a soft *pop* of petals unfurling.

“Did you see that?” Yonatan burst out, his voice bright with excitement. He dropped to his knees so fast he nearly tipped the basket, leaning close like he meant to drink in the sight. He liked small things, but not in a hush-and-whisper way — more in the way you like something you can’t wait to show your friends. His pockets were always full of treasures: a green beetle wing that gleamed like glass, a feather with a bold black-and-white stripe, a smooth river-stone he rubbed with his thumb when he was thinking or just because it felt nice. The stone had been very cool that morning. Now it was warm.

Danielle, taller by not very much and full of the sort of energy that makes stones want to skip themselves across ponds, pushed past a thorny cane and squinted into the trees. “Look,” she said. “There.”

Beyond the brambles, a narrow path lay brighter than it should have been—as if the sun had spilled a bit of itself there and forgotten to take it back. The brightness didn’t blaze. It hummed, the way a kettle hums just before it sings.

“We’re not supposed to go past the—” Yonatan began, but the hum pressed very gently at the middle of his chest, where a drum might be if children had drums inside them instead of hearts. The drum answered, very softly: *thrum*.

Noam tilted her head. “It feels like the forest is asking us to come see something,” she said. “If the forest asks politely, it would be rude not to go.”

“It’s only polite if you listen carefully,” Yonatan said, because that is what you say when you hope for both. He rubbed the river-stone with his thumb. It had warmed to the same hum as his chest.

Danielle did not wait for the end of either argument. She had a knack—half impulse, half magic—that showed her, for a heartbeat, two flickers of light on the ground: one the bold way forward, one the safe way around. They flashed faint as fireflies and then were gone. She did not always choose the bold one. Only often.

“Come on,” she said. “It’s practically a path.”

“It is a path,” Noam agreed, delighted. “A polite one.”

“Yes, but—” Yonatan tried again, and then sighed. He tucked the striped feather deeper into his pocket museum, gripped the warm stone, and followed.

They stepped past the brambles and into the Greenwood proper, and the Greenwood, for all its strangeness, obliged them with a path that curled gently between the trees. The light was a green-gold now, warm as tea out of the sun, and the bees traded the hum of the thickets for the hush of the under-leaves. Fern fronds brushed their elbows like friendly cats. A leaf-shaped shadow darted across their feet—then stopped and simply became a leaf. Things like that happened in the Greenwood and were not considered rude.

“Don’t dawdle,” Danielle said, though she herself slowed now and then to listen when the humming drew her eye one way or another. “We can explore after we see what it wants to show us.”

“I’m not dawdling,” Noam said, half-singing it. “I’m savoring.” She tapped a fern and it shivered, pleased. When she laughed again—at a beetle wearing raindrop boots, at a mushroom that looked exactly like an umbrella but was too small even for a mouse—the air above the moss lit with a scatter of pale motes. The motes spiraled up and widened into an oval, then thinned and vanished like breath on a window.

“Did you do that on purpose?” Yonatan asked, curious and a little nervous.

“I don’t do things on purpose,” Noam said seriously. “They do themselves on purpose when I’m near.”

“She means yes,” Danielle translated, though she wasn’t truly listening. She had paused, eyes narrowed, where the path forked—one fork a faint drift of light leading gently left, the other a brighter prickle leading onward beneath low branches. For an instant—just an instant—she saw them both labeled in her mind with a kind of inner glimmer. *Safe.* *Bold.*

Danielle’s heart hopped. “It’s this way,” she said, and ducked beneath the lower branches.

“Of course it is,” Yonatan said to the branch, which had just dropped a leaf on his head. “It’s always that way.” He plucked the leaf from his hair and studied it. It had a curious silvery sheen. He slipped it into his pocket museum for later.

The hum in their chests deepened as they walked, faint but steady, like a heartbeat in a shell when you press it to your ear. The forest’s ordinary noises—thrushes asking their questions, bees telling jokes only bees find funny, the tiny bickering of ants—thinned until even Danielle’s quick steps seemed loud. Noam began to hum back under her breath, a lilting tune that wasn’t quite a tune. Yonatan nearly joined, then decided he preferred the listening.

They reached a small glade that looked, at first, like the end of their search. Light poured down through a hole in the canopy, and every blade of grass wore a necklace of dew that glittered so brightly it made you blink. In the middle of the glade, a shallow dip in the bedrock held rainwater, clear as glass, the exact size and shape of a giant’s palm. The surface reflected the leaves above and the children peering in. When a single droplet fell from a high leaf and struck, the whole shallow pool rippled, and for an instant the reflected leaves became something else—sails on far water, smoke-curl from chimneys, a white path cutting through dark pines.

Noam breathed, “Oh.”

Yonatan swallowed. “Is that—?”

But before the question could finish being a question, the reflection was only leaves again, and their three small faces, wavery and serious.

Danielle crouched and set two fingers in the water. It felt exactly like rain. Cool, ordinary, sighingly pleasant on a warm day. “Not it,” she decided, standing. “Pretty, but not it.”

“Something showed,” Yonatan said. “I know it did.”

“Puddles show all sorts of things if you look kindly,” Noam said, not disappointed. “But it’s not the thing we’re meant to see.”

“How do you know?” Danielle asked.

“Because the humming came from *there*,” Noam said, pointing past the glade. “Listen.”

They listened. The hum sat like a thread through the quiet. Danielle heard it as a pull in her feet. Yonatan felt it in his palms—one warm with stone, one cool with the memory of rainwater. And Noam, who had a way with gently shifting things, felt it like a small hand in the air, tugging her sleeve.

They stepped through the far side of the glade. The path was narrower now, walled with moss that rose almost to their waists. Here the air grew cooler, and the light changed — greener, thicker, as if every leaf had leaned closer to watch them pass. The hum deepened, the kind you feel in your ribs more than hear with your ears.

“Feels like we’re walking into a story,” Noam murmured.

“We are a story,” Danielle said, ducking beneath a low bough without slowing.

Yonatan ran his hand over the moss, squeezing a handful just to feel how springy it was. “I bet foxes sleep in this!” he said, and crouched to press his cheek to it before Danielle pulled him along.

The path dipped. At the bottom of the dip lay a pool — not a puddle, not a trickle from rain, but a true pond, round as a coin and dark as polished stone. The surface was so still that it seemed solid, and for a moment they thought it might be.

Then the center moved.

It was not a ripple. It was not a fish. The water lifted itself, a round swell like a breath taken beneath, and from it rose a face.

She was not like the mermaids in picture books. Her hair was not yellow or red, but the shifting silver of minnows. Her skin was pale green, as though she’d been carved from the light under lily pads. Her eyes were the exact color of the pond — deep, steady, and reflecting more than they revealed.

Noam drew in a breath. Danielle took a step forward. Yonatan’s hand went into his pocket, curling around his stone.

The mermaid’s mouth curved. “I have been waiting,” she said.

Her voice was like water over smooth rocks. It was not loud, but it carried through them in the same way the hum had. In fact, they realized, the hum was her.

“Waiting for who?” Danielle asked.

“For you,” she said simply. “The forest brought you, and the pond held its breath until you came.”

“Why?” Yonatan asked before he could stop himself.

The mermaid’s gaze touched him like cool rain. “Because you carry small things that matter. Because each of you holds a key, though you do not yet know the doors.”

Noam’s laugh trembled. “We don’t have keys.”

“You do,” the mermaid said. “One of light” — she looked at Noam — “one of daring” — her eyes warmed on Danielle — “and one of keeping.” Her gaze lingered on Yonatan.

The pond swelled again, as if the whole body of water had sighed. “I will show you only once,” she said.

She lifted a hand from the water, and in her palm floated a bubble. Inside the bubble was a picture: a bridge made of branches and light, spanning a chasm full of mist. On the far side of the bridge stood a tall stone archway covered in ivy, its doorway dark.

“This is ahead of you,” the mermaid said. “Not tomorrow, not the day after — but ahead. You will know it when you see it. Remember the bridge.”

The bubble drifted toward them, and just as Noam reached out to touch it, it popped. The pond was still again. The mermaid was gone.

For a long moment they didn’t speak.

Danielle was the first to break the quiet. “Well. That was… something.”

“It was important,” Yonatan said softly.

“Yes,” Noam agreed. “And beautiful.”

The hum was gone now, replaced by the ordinary sounds of the Greenwood — birdsong, leaf-rustle, the far-off tapping of a woodpecker. Somehow, those sounds felt different, as if the forest had drawn a curtain between what was just theirs and what it wanted the children to see.

They made their way back along the winding path. None of them suggested hurrying. Even Danielle seemed content to walk at the same pace as the others. Yonatan kept one hand in his pocket, thumb on the warm stone, the other swinging as he hopped over roots and pointed out every mushroom they passed. Noam hummed quietly, the tune almost the same as the mermaid’s voice. Danielle kept glancing behind, just in case the pond decided to follow.

At the blackberry brambles, the forest seemed to loosen its hold. Sunlight poured back in. The air felt less like a secret and more like a day again.

Their mother was waiting by the cottage gate, hands on hips. “Well? Did you get any berries?”

Danielle held up the empty basket. “Not exactly.”

“You’d better have a good reason,” their mother said.

They exchanged a look. Noam smiled faintly. “We found the pond that waited.”

Their mother raised one brow but didn’t press. Sometimes in Greenwood matters, she knew better than to ask twice.

The three of them went inside, berryless, but carrying more than they had left with.

And far away, in the green-gold depths of the forest, a pond lay still, holding the memory of three small faces above its dark, patient water.
