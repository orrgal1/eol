# Ch. 0: The First Light

In the heart of Wonderlight, where rivers run like ribbons of silver and clouds sometimes pause to watch the world below, there lies a valley no map can quite remember. The hills fold around it like a green cloak, and in the middle — just where the morning sun first lands — stands the little village of Windmere.

It was the sort of place where every chimney knew the scent of its own smoke, and where the cobbled paths seemed to hum when you walked them. The air was always filled with something — the chime of a distant bell, the murmur of wind through the cottonwillow trees, or the soft, surprising laughter of the three children who would one day change the fate of all Wonderlight.

There was Noam. She had a gaze that wandered far beyond the horizon and a laugh that could coax shy flowers into bloom. Taller than the other two, she often strolled with her hands clasped behind her back, as if strolling through her own daydreams.

Beside her walked Danielle, quick of step and quicker of thought, with eyes like sparks and a grin that often meant trouble was just about to happen. Where Noam would pause to imagine what might be hiding behind a hedge, Danielle would be halfway through climbing over it.

And then there was Yonatan, smaller than both, though never in heart. His pockets were forever heavy with curious things — a curled feather, a pebble shaped like a sleeping cat, a seed that glowed faintly when the moon was full. He spoke little, but when he did, his words always seemed to matter more than most.

The three of them had grown up with Wonderlight’s magic the way fish grow up with water: it was simply there, part of every step, every breath. They knew the forest paths where light poured like gold through the branches, and the hidden pools where you could hear the stars singing if you listened just right.

But on the day this story truly begins, they did not yet know that Wonderlight itself had been watching them — and waiting. For the world has a way of choosing its heroes long before they feel ready, and the First Light of adventure was already kindling at their feet.
