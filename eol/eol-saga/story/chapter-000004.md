# Ashes

For a long while he lay at the center of the ruin, the chill of the earth seeping through his back, the sky a somber gray blanket. Breath returned slowly, each one drawing in the scent of scorched timber and cold ash. The ruin lay quiet about him—no wingbeat, no whisper of wind—only the faint crackle of embers deep within the blackened earth. Time stretched thin, marked only by the settling of char and the slow drift of pale smoke toward the sky.

At last he turned onto his side, palm pressing into the grit, and pushed himself upright. His limbs felt heavy, as though the ground itself were loath to let him go. He came to his knees at the heart of the blackened circle, where the soil still held the faint tremor of fire’s passing. Here his parents had fallen, and here all warmth had been scoured away.

He bowed low until his forehead nearly touched the place where his father had stood his last. From this ground he would take only what could be carried: the twin blades, the broken haft of a staff, and a fragment of fire now bound to his own heart—a burden he had not sought, yet would bear for their sake. But he was not ready to turn from them, not yet.

“Brenden.” Mireth’s voice came from behind him, low, almost tentative against the vast quiet.

He did not answer. His gaze stayed fixed upon the ashen ground. Slowly, he reached down, gathered a handful of grey dust, and let it trickle through his fingers until nothing remained.

Her footsteps drew nearer. She stopped just behind him.

“Brenden, we cannot stay.”

He picked at a splinter of blackened wood beside his knee, rolling it between his fingers until it crumbled.

“Come — we must not be here come dawn. That pillar of light will have been seen from afar. Word will spread of it and draw danger.”

He brushed the crumbs of charcoal from his palm, eyes still on the ground. Only then did he lift his head a fraction, enough to catch the edge of her shadow by the light of the moon.

“Your parents were good people Brenden. They loved you. They died so that you may live. And now they rest.” 

“You bear your father’s fire, but it will be long ere you can use it.”

Then her voice softened. “Come. Let us go while yet our strength holds.”

He looked up fully, the hollowness of the place reflected in his gaze. Mireth waited, patient, her hand firm upon his shoulder. At last, he nodded. Rising slowly, he brushed the black dust from his palms, then crossed to the edge of the ruin. There he knelt once more and picked up a small smooth rock, pressing it into his pocket—a tiny piece of before.

She watched in silence, then pulled her cloak close, her gaze narrowing against the wind. “This day has taken it’s toll on us both. We need shelter—and time to heal, if we are to go on. Is there anywhere near, Brenden? Somewhere you trust?”

He gave a slow nod. “The Lowfields farm, west through the woods. My father trusted them. I worked there a season and we would visit there once in a while. I reckon if any door will open after what happened here, it will be theirs.”

She turned her gaze west. “How far?”

“Ten miles—perhaps less if we cut the forest paths. Mostly woodland and old pasture. It will be rough now with snow but it will keep us off the valley road.”

She studied the distance in silence, her gaze tracing the black seam of the treeline until it faded into the dim blur of the night-snow. “It is farther than I would wish,” she said at last, “I’ve seen been days than this one, yet the choice is made for us. Lead on—and keep to the shadows, even if the miles grow longer.”

He did not look back. Snow had begun to drift again, falling soft upon the blackened earth, veiling the ruin. Behind them, the place he had lived his entire life sank quietly beneath the white, leaving only the faint press of two sets of footprints leading away into the dark.

The land west of the ruin yielded nothing freely. Here and there, where axes had once bitten deep, small clearings lay under a crust of wind-hardened snow, their furrows long blurred by grass and saplings. Between them pressed the forest, dark and close, the treetops burdened with white. Each step was a question—sometimes the ground gave way, sometimes it struck back like stone. Above, the sky was a blind roof of cloud, the boughs leaning inward as though to close the way.

Mireth followed in his track, her pace measured, each footfall fitting neatly into the hollows his boots had pressed in the snow. At first she moved with the ease of long practice, the rhythm of her steps even, the set of her shoulders unbroken. Her gaze stayed fixed ahead, and the plume of her breath rose and fell in steady clouds, dissolving among the black weave of the trees.

She adjusted her cloak now and then, shifting the fold across her chest or settling it more snug about her neck. Once she brushed the hilt of her sword, fingers closing around the leather for a moment before letting go. They were the small, unconscious motions of a seasoned traveller, not yet touched by strain.

Yet before long, she began to feel the weight of that night and the day before it. The bursts of breath lost their quiet regularity, quickening by slow degrees until they came deeper, harsher, each one laced with a faint rasp. Her boots no longer bit the snow so cleanly; their sound grew uneven, crunch followed by drag. She touched her side once in passing, as though brushing off a stray fold of cloak—but then her hand returned, settling there longer, fingers spreading across her ribs before she dropped them again.

By the next rise her posture had altered, almost imperceptibly: the square set of her shoulders had eased forward, her head inclined just enough that the edge of her hood shadowed her face. When she looked up again, her eyes sought the trail ahead with more care than before, as though gauging each stretch before she took it. Her jaw worked now and then between breaths, the muscles there tightening in small pulses.

She still walked without complaint, still kept her place close behind him, but the signs had gathered—quiet as falling snow, and no less certain in their weight.

When she lagged, Brenden slowed also—never abruptly, never enough to make her feel pitied. He would pause to shift his coat against the wind, tug at a glove, or test the snow ahead with his boot until she drew level again.

The silences grew longer. Words, when spoken, came short, practical, and pitched low to save breath. The snow between them held the measure of their passage: his stride firm, hers now marked by the faint drag of a boot at the end of each step.

Little by little, she began to fall behind. At first the gap was no more than a stride, then two, then more, until her steps no longer matched his prints in the snow. She kept her eyes fixed ahead, refusing to acknowledge the distance gathering between them.

At a gap in an old fence where the snow climbed above their knees, Brenden caught her as she stumbled over a half-buried rail. “The way’s not easy,” he said. “The ground rises soon. We’ll skirt the hollow—keep to the pines.”

She nodded without meeting his eye, her teeth set against the pain.

The wind came in sharp eddies, sweeping the open ground, veils of snow curling past their boots. Twice they met thickets where bramble and wild rose, their thorns hidden beneath the white, forced them wide of the track. When Mireth tripped, Brenden took her elbow in both hands, feeling the tremor in her arm.

“You’re bleeding,” he said softly, seeing the dark spread beneath her binding.

“I will manage,” she answered, pressing her palm over the wound, and they went on.

The woods began to climb, then dropped steeply into a gully where the snow lay deepest. Mireth faltered there and leaned hard upon Brenden’s arm, near toppling him. A stand of poplars shivered ahead in the wind, and under their grey trunks they stopped to draw what warmth they could from the pause. Her breath was ragged; his ears strained for other sounds, but there was only the wind and the low grind of hunger in his gut.

When they set forward again, another fence barred their path, its rails lost under a tangle of bramble. Brenden tried his hands against it, but the thorns bit deep. Drawing one of his mother’s blades, he sawed at the growth, yet it was slow work.

Mireth unbuckled her sword and offered it hilt-first. “It is lighter than it seems. Cut high and low—these thorns turn back under the snow.”

He took it, the grip stiff beneath his gloves, and hacked a path, the cold biting at each movement. Mireth steadied herself against a post, her face taut. When the way stood open, Brenden kept the sword in hand, mistrusting what the next barrier might bring.

They crawled through, cloth catching on hidden thorns, knees stinging from the cold. Once out Mireth stayed bent leaning on her knees, her shoulders shaking, and waved him back when he moved to help.

“I need but a moment,” she said through rough breath.

He stood silent, watching the frost catch on the black limbs above. When at last she straightened, they pressed on. Brenden used the blade to break the crusted drifts and clear the brush, each stroke jarring his numbed hands.

A frozen stream barred their way. Brenden went first, tapping ahead with the sword until he was sure the ice would bear them. On the far bank, Mireth slipped to one knee; he caught her hand and helped her up, and they climbed the next rise together.

The wind sharpened, driving ice into their faces, slipping through every seam. Mireth’s steps grew shorter, her weight at times heavy against his shoulder.

Dawn came pale. Beneath ancient alders, their branches bent with rime, they halted once more. Mireth braced herself on her knees again, Brenden at her side, sword lowered, his breath harsh.

He waited, giving her the silence. The woods closed tight ahead—root-laced ground under deep drifts, trunks pressed close together. A pale gleam through the trees hinted at open snow in the far distance. Brenden studied the shadows, tracing a way between birch and pine, noting where old stones and fallen logs might offer shelter.

She straightened, slowly, as though rising through water. Her breath caught, steadied. Lines of weariness etched sharp across her brow, and in her eyes, something distant—fixed not on pain, but on enduring it.

She scanned the tangled woodland, the slopes and shadows, the faint paling of the sky through the trees. Her hand dropped to her side again, pressing lightly, not from weakness now, but habit.

When she spoke, it was after a silence long enough for the wind to shift.

“…How far?”

Brenden searched the dark weave of trunks, tracing where the undergrowth thinned into a faint line of passage. “Some miles yet,” he said at last, “but we are more than halfway. We’ll keep to cover. There’s fir ahead—a windbreak for a short stretch, then thicker woods, all the way to the farm.”

Her hand stayed at her side, fingers rigid over the wound. She gave a single nod. For a time neither moved. The alders above them hissed in the wind, their limbs bending under the weight of rime.

Brenden turned toward her. “Ready?”

Her eyes met his, dull with fatigue, and she inclined her head once. “Ready.”

They stepped from the shelter of the alders into the denser wood. The forest showed no mercy. Snow lay deep in every hollow, crusted where the wind had scoured it, loose and treacherous where it had drifted. Gullies forced them down and up again, ice-slick on the climbs. Low boughs hung heavy, sweeping at their faces; thorns, buried beneath the white, tore at their legs unseen.

The pain in her side returned first as a sharp stitch, then dulled to an ache that spread through her ribs and across her back. She kept her strength by the steady, hard press of her palm against it, by the grit of her teeth, by the simple task of keeping Brenden’s shape in sight.

The shivering began without warning. At first it was a small tremor in her hands, then a stiffness in her stride. Her breath came quick and shallow; her teeth clicked together with each step. The edges of her vision blurred, then brightened with small white flecks when she stumbled.

Damp worked through her gloves, seeping past the weave until her fingers stiffened, blood and sweat cooling into numbness. The wind cut into her wrists where the cloth pulled away.

The snow climbed higher up her boots. The ground shifted beneath them—sometimes a sudden dip, sometimes the hard knock of buried stone. Twice she lost Brenden’s track and stood swaying in the wind until his hand closed around hers and drew her forward.

The world began to narrow. A feather of frost on a branch. The heavy thump of her heart in her ears. The faint sound of Brenden’s boots ahead, steady and unbroken. Moments of sharp clarity came and went, each one swallowed again by a soft, creeping haze.

The ache in her side spread and thickened, slowing her even more. She felt her eyes close without willing it, opening only to the pressure of Brenden’s grip or the pull of his arm. The trunks closed tighter around them, the stillness between them deepening. Only their breath and the muffled press of snow remained to prove to her that they moved at all.

Fragments of thought began to drift—faces half-remembered, a winter far away, the faint lilt of a song she had not heard in decades. She moved within those shadows, returning to the present only when the weight of Brenden’s hand shifted or his arm steadied her.

Eventually her legs grew unreliable. Stumbling became constant. She felt more of her weight pass to Brenden with every step. His pace slowed, but his grip never eased. The sun’s climb was lost to her. The cold had gone beyond her skin, deep into the marrow. Her breathing had to be summoned, each draw deliberate, each release shallow. The air itself felt heavy, its cold cutting at her lungs.

When the woods at last began to open and the land fell away, her senses had dwindled to three points—the throb of her wound, the bite of the wind, and the pull of Brenden’s unyielding hand.

She tried to speak, to ask how far, but her tongue was heavy, her lips numb. The trees blurred, their shapes bending and wavering. At the edges of her sight, shadows moved as if they were people—once her mother’s face, waiting ahead; once a flare of firelight in the branches; once Brenden’s voice calling from a place far in front of her, though his hand still held hers. Each blink remade the world into something else, distorted and uncertain.

Her steps began to falter even more sharply, as though the ground itself had grown steeper. Breath no longer came on its own; she had to call it up from somewhere deep, and even then it came thin. Her knees buckled and she caught herself only because Brenden’s arm was there. The world shrank completely to the small circle of her steps. Cold on the wind. The weight of snow on her shoulders. The faint taste of iron in her mouth.

Her legs failed without warning. She pitched forward into Brenden’s arms. His voice was near, urgent, but the words reached her only as sound, stripped of meaning. He pulled her upright and half-dragged her forward. She tried to set her feet, but the command never reached her muscles.

The cold promised rest. Her head sagged forward; her breath thinned to a faint rattle. Brenden’s voice came again—“Not far now… hold on… stay with me”—but the pines swallowed the sound before it reached her.

She willed her body to answer. Nothing moved.

Her knees struck the ground; pain bloomed faintly, as though at a distance. Brenden’s hands were at her cloak, shaking her, his face close, but it was already receding into the dim. Snow drifted past her sight, each flake slow and soundless.

Above, the sky flickered pale between the branches—then dimmed.

She let go. The cold closed in, patient and complete, until even the ache was gone.

Brenden dropped to his knees, breath tearing at his throat. Mireth lay where she had fallen, her body slack, the pallor of her face leached to something almost grey. Her lips were parted, eyes half-lidded and without focus.

He tore away a glove and pressed his fingertips to her throat. Her skin was ice, unyielding under his touch—but there, faint and stubborn, a pulse beat on, fragile as a thread in the wind.

“Mireth,” he breathed, the word catching in his chest. He shook her lightly at first, then with more force. “Mireth. Wake.” His voice rose, roughened. “Mireth! Look at me!”

Only the wind answered, sifting through the pines with its long, hollow whisper.

His coat was off in an instant. He wrapped it around her shoulders, drawing it close at the throat, tucking the edges tight under her arms and around her sides. The cold bit into his own bare arms and chest, but he paid it no mind.

His gaze darted over the ground, seeking anything—a hollow, a fallen trunk, some shelter from the wind’s edge. The forest gave little. At the base of an old pine he found a shallow dip, half-scooped by roots and time. It was meagre, but better than nothing.

He slid his arms beneath her and hauled her there, settling her upright against the trunk. He packed snow at her back and sides, trying to shape a windbreak. His hands, numbed to clumsiness, fumbled with the work.

“Stay awake,” he urged, slapping her cheek lightly, then again. He shook her by the shoulders, trying to will her eyes to focus. “I’m going to get help. I’ll come back. You’re not alone—do you hear me?”

Her eyelids fluttered; her lips moved, forming shapes without sound. For an instant he thought she might speak, but the breath vanished between them, stolen by the cold.

He leaned close until their foreheads touched. His own breath came ragged. “I’ll come back,” he whispered, the words shaking. “I swear it.”

He pulled away, wiped his face on a stiff, frozen sleeve, and forced his body upright. His legs felt like stone as he turned toward the west and began to run.

The woods were thick around him. Branches clawed at his sleeves; the snow dragged at his boots as though the earth itself wished to keep him from moving. He clawed through thickets, slipped on glassy ice hidden under powder, stumbled down into hollows where the cold was heavier.

His breath burned in his lungs, each draw of air a rasp. His vision shimmered at the edges, but he pressed on.

He fixed every landmark in his mind—a leaning birch, the fork of a frozen stream, the way a split cedar arched like a bow across the path. He forced himself to note every crooked trunk, every rise and fall of ground, counting each one against the risk of losing his way when he returned. Upon a while he would turn back and burn the image of the way into his mind. Hoping to draw on the memory for the return journey.

In his head, he marked the sounds: the crunch of snow, the creak of his boots, the whip of branches when he broke through them. Anything to keep from hearing the silence behind him, where Mireth lay with her breath so faint he had to believe—had to believe—it still came.

From time to time he muttered under his breath, the words falling rough and low—half prayer, half command to his own limbs. At others he spoke to his legs as though they were stubborn beasts, willing them to keep their pace, to carry him one more step, and then another.

The light began to change—first a dim thinning of shadow, then a cold, pale wash creeping through the trees.

He crested a rise and looked west, hoping for a glimpse of the farm—but the fields lay empty. His gaze swept the land until, near due south, a thread of chimney-smoke lifted into the cold air.

“I’ve strayed north,” he said under his breath.

He set off at a jog toward the distant plume. The last stretch was a torment; his legs burned, his breath tore at his throat. Still he pressed on, refusing to slow or pause for breath. Grudging every moment lost.

At long last a fencepost rose ahead, dark and rimed with frost. Beyond it, a faint track led down to a wide clearing. There, crouched low against the wind, stood the Lowfields’ main house, its roof thick with snow.

Brenden half-stumbled through the gate, the sword still clutched in his hand. He mounted the steps two at a time and hammered at the door with the flat of his fist, the blows echoing in the quiet.

A flicker of lamplight moved behind the curtain. He stepped back, chest heaving, trying to draw enough breath to speak.

The door opened, and Meed Lowfield stood there—broad in the shoulders despite the stoop of age, his face lined from years in the wind, eyes keen and measuring. His gaze went first to the sword, then to Brenden’s face.

“Who’s there? What trouble brings you breaking my door at sun-up?”

“It’s Brenden,” he managed between breaths. “Eadric’s son… from the east valley… we were attacked…”

Recognition softened Meed’s eyes, though suspicion still held in his voice. “Brenden? What happened up there last night? And whence comes that blade?”

The words came clumsy, thick with cold. “Not mine. Mireth—she’s hurt… bad. I couldn’t carry her. She’s freezing, and I—” His voice broke; he caught it back. “Please. She’ll die if we don’t go now.”

Meed’s gaze lingered on the sword, then lifted again to Brenden, reading the grime on his coat, the blood on his sleeves.

“Where is she?”

“Two miles almost due east… in the woods. A hollow near the pines. My coat’s with her—she’s fading fast.”

He drew a sharp breath, jaw working, and turned his head toward the stairs. “Joss! Rallin! Up with you! Bring blankets, a board, rope—move!”

The thunder of boots answered him. Joss and Rallin, both broad-shouldered and heavy in step, crowded into the hall. “Stretcher!” Meed barked. “Throws from the chest!”

Meed pulled a thick coat from a hook and thrust it into Brenden’s hands. “Take this. Can you walk?”

Brenden nodded, still fighting for breath. “I can take you. It’s rough… we’ll have to retrace the path I took here. She’s not heavy, but—”

“We’ll see to her,” Meed cut in, already winding a scarf around his mouth. His sons shouldered their gear and stepped past, moving quick and without waste.

Brenden followed, but Meed stopped him with a hand on his shoulder. “That blade—leave it here. No one will touch it. You’ve no need of it now.”

Brenden hesitated, then stepped inside just long enough to lay the sword on a low shelf, the twin blades beside it, and the broken staff between them. He rested his hand there a moment, as if speaking to them without sound. “I’ll come back for you,” he murmured.

Then he turned and followed the Lowfield men into the pale morning, where the stretcher was ready and the blankets bundled. The air was knife-cold, their breaths clouding in the dim light, and the snow under their boots gave the only sound as they set off toward the east.

They plunged into the woods, Brenden taking the lead. The drifts had thickened, swallowing hollows and ridges alike until the way was little more than a guess. Joss and Rallin hauled the stretcher between them, Lowfield bringing up the rear. Branches scraped the board at every turn, and snow had begun to fall again, the flakes slanting through the trees and settling in their hair and beards.

Brenden lost count of his own slips and stumbles; more than once Joss caught his arm before he went down completely. He called out what markers he knew—“Split pine—mind your head. Bent post just ahead. Stones at the drop, slick under the snow.”—the words quick, each one pulled out between breaths. With every step, the weight in his chest grew heavier, a dread that tightened until it hurt to breathe. What if he had taken too long? What if she had slipped past the point of help? The cold and the wound could already have claimed her.

The land began to shift under the new snow and dim light. For several hundred yards , where the snow was not thick and his boot prints faded, the woods felt altered, as if the trees had moved while he was away. Hollows bled into one another; ridgelines seemed shallower, unfamiliar. Brenden slowed without meaning to, and the others bunched close behind him.

Doubt clawed in. Every tree mirrored its neighbor, every drift lay in the same curves. If they passed her now, they might never find her. She would vanish under the drift before they knew. He stood still, chest heaving, scanning the gloom. Then—just ahead—he saw it: the jagged, snow-capped limb of a fir tree, half-buried, broken clean across. He knew that shape. Beyond it, the ground dipped sharply into a gully.

Brenden lifted a hand, signaling them to hold, then moved forward, peering down into the hollow. There—faint but certain—lay the marks of his own boots, pressed into the snow and half-filled by the wind. Relief struck him so sudden it left him dizzy. He pointed. “There! Down the gully—only a few hundred yards!”

They found her where he had left her. She lay curled against the pine, Brenden’s coat drawn up close about her shoulders, snow packed high around her legs and hips. Her face had gone the color of old marble, lips edged in blue.

Lowfield knelt first, pressing two fingers to her throat. “Still here,” he said, voice clipped. “Rallin—lift her easy. Joss, slide the board under. Brenden—take her feet.”

They moved efficiently, but with care, easing her onto the stretcher and tucking the blankets around her. They secured her to the board with a bit of rope for the way was rough. She did not wake; only a faint, broken sound escaped as they shifted her weight.

The return was slow, the path harder under the extra burden. Lowfield took the lead now, turning them onto a different track. Roots snagged at their boots, and the drifts pulled like hands at their legs. Rallin slipped once, Lowfield cursed softly, and Joss bent to heave the board higher against his shoulder.

Brenden kept his place at Mireth’s side, one hand fixed to the edge of the blankets. He watched her face for any sign—a breath deeper than the last, the flicker of a lash—but her stillness held. His own legs shook, and the cold felt as though it had entered his bones. Sweat froze along his brow. Once he went down to his knees in a drift, his hands sinking deep; Joss caught him by the collar and hauled him up.

“Nearly there, lad,” Joss said, his voice roughened by breath. “Don’t stop now.”

He nodded and pressed forward.

The last slope was the worst—steep and narrow, the ground tilting beneath them. Mireth slid toward the edge of the board and Rallin swore, steadying her with one gloved hand while Lowfield fought for balance at the front. The sun, thin and cold above the treetops, gave no warmth. Only the faint ribbon of chimney smoke ahead held any promise.

Then the yard opened before them, blessedly breaking from the trees. The Lowfield house stood square and solid in the pale gold of morning, smoke curling thick from the chimney. A flurry of hens scattered ahead of their boots.

Inside, Wenna Lowfield and her daughter Marra had already cleared a space before the hearth—bench shoved aside, worn blankets unrolled, a place marked close enough to the flames for the heat to reach her quickly.

They crossed the threshold into the closeness of fire and bodies, the sudden warmth almost painful after the long cold. Snowmelt pooled on the boards as boots stamped and gear was shed. Wenna’s voice cut through the bustle, calm but brisk.

“Here—lower her gentle. Spread those blankets over the hot stones. More wood on the fire! Quick now.”

The air was already shifting—woodsmoke and hot stone chasing out the scent of frost and pine—as they bent to bring Mireth back from the edge.

They lowered her onto the rugs before the fire. Wenna dropped to her knees beside her, unfastening Brenden’s coat and pulling it away, the heavy wool falling sodden to the side. One layer after another came off—cloak, tunic—until pale, stiff limbs lay bare to the heat. Her hands moved without pause, pressing along Mireth’s jaw, over the hollow of her throat, down to her chest. She sought breath and pulse, finding them faint but present, then began kneading warmth into bone and muscle.

“She’s near gone with it,” Wenna said, voice low and grim, her eyes never leaving Mireth’s face.

Marra came to her side, taking one of Mireth’s hands and cupping it between both of hers, rubbing each finger in turn before working up the arm. Together they rolled her gently, rubbing her back, chafing the skin at her elbows, working the cold from the hollows of her joints. Their motions were steady, tireless, as they coaxed life back into the body before them.

“Breathe for us now,” Wenna murmured. “Come back. That’s it. Keep with us.”

The younger daughter Renna, her arms laden with towels and wraps, stood hovering until she caught sight of Brenden slumped against the wall, head bowed, shoulders slack. She crossed quickly to him, dropped a folded blanket over his shoulders, and crouched in front of him, her own breath quick and clouding.

“You’re freezing,” she said softly, as though the room were holding a fragile silence. Her chilled fingers worked at the laces of his boots, tugging them loose and setting them aside by the stove to steam.

A moment later, she pressed a mug into his hands—hot broth, the heat of it almost shocking against his skin. “Drink. Slow. You look almost as bad as she does.”

Brenden managed the smallest nod. His voice would not come; his hands shook so that the surface rippled. He sipped, the heat stinging his throat and face, its taste sharp and unfamiliar. His eyes drifted past her, fixed on the two figures by the fire.

Wenna and Marra had unbound Mireth’s wound and replaced the bloodied wrap with a strip torn from an old sheet, white against her skin. Hot stones, swaddled in cloth, were tucked at her feet. Wenna kept her hands moving, checking her breathing again and again. “Come on, girl,” she said, her tone both fierce and kind. “No quitting here.”

A faint tightening of Mireth’s jaw came, then a brief shiver. Wenna leaned closer, bracing an arm around her shoulders while Marra cradled her head, brushing damp hair back from her brow. They worked over her without pause—rubbing her calves, rolling her arms gently back and forth, chafing warmth into her cheeks, keeping her limbs in motion so the blood would not slow.

The fire burned high, the wood popping and shifting, its heat spreading into the room—slow, stubborn, alive. Rallin and Joss stood near the wall, boots dripping onto the stones, their eyes on their mother, waiting for her to speak.

Renna, finished with Brenden’s boots, took his hands between hers, working warmth back into his fingers. Her own face was pale but steady. “Easy,” she said, her eyes searching his. “She’ll come through. Ma’s seen worse.”

Brenden’s reply was only a slight nod. His gaze stayed fixed on Mireth, searching for the faintest rise of breath, the smallest movement. Heat was settling in his belly from the broth, but he barely felt it. His eyes burned, and tears slid unheeded down his cheeks, cooling as they fell.

Still, Wenna and Marra worked on. They turned Mireth carefully, wrapped her again as the shuddering became more regular, rubbed life into her hands and feet. Wenna murmured words meant only for her. Marra’s hands never left her skin. The house was quiet save for the fire, the wind’s sigh at the door, and the small sounds of care—the rustle of cloth, the slow scrape of stone against stone in the hearth.

Then, after what felt like hours, color returned—faint, but real—at Mireth’s lips. Her breathing deepened, the tremors running the length of her body. Wenna leaned back at last, her shoulders loosening.

“She’s not through it yet,” she said quietly, “but she’s come back to us.” She glanced toward Brenden, her voice gentler. “You too. You’ve done your share. Rest now.”

He tried to answer, but the words tangled. Renna’s hand was warm on his arm. The weight of the blanket pressed him down. The firelight blurred, and warmth began to creep into limbs that had long forgotten it.

Still, his eyes did not leave Mireth. Even as the room dimmed at the edges, even as his head began to sink forward, he kept watching for the moment she would wake—when breath and warmth would carry her wholly back from the edge.

As the sounds of labor eased, Meed Lowfield stepped away from his sons and came to where Brenden sat slumped against the wall. His coat was open, shoulders dusted with the last flakes of snow, hands mottled red from the cold.

Brenden blinked up at him, vision blurred by fatigue. The mug trembled faintly between his fingers.

Meed regarded him a long moment, grey eyes searching his face, then glanced toward the hearth where Wenna and Marra still worked over Mireth. Their movements had slowed now, though they did not cease. Renna lingered nearby, drying Brenden’s gloves, her face pale and intent.

“Wasn’t just any trouble up there,” Meed said at last, his voice pitched low. “We saw the sky ourselves—me and the boys. Couldn’t sleep. Heard hooves on the road—more than a pair. Then came the thunder, like a quarry wall breaking loose, but sharper. Not the noise of a storm. And the light—red first, then a white so bright it turned the snow blue. Set every crow in the valley to screaming.”

The words hung there, waiting.

Brenden tried to still his hands, but memory stirred—the ruin lit by fire, his parents’ faces in the last stand, the shudder of the earth. His mouth felt dry as ash. Caution held his tongue, though truth pressed against it.

“There was a fight,” he managed at last. His voice was hoarse, thread-thin. “More than I could count. They came after us.” He glanced toward Mireth. “I don’t know how many, nor why they came. They burned it all. My—” He stopped, unable to push the word past his teeth.

Meed’s jaw tightened. “We saw flames shoot above the trees, like harvest bonfires—but wrong. And that white flash… never seen the like. Not even in midsummer storms.” He studied Brenden’s face, the shadowed eyes, the crusted blood at his collar. “Was it sorcery? Like the kind the elders whispered of after the war? My father spoke of such things, but I never thought I’d see it here, in Brannock.”

Brenden shook his head faintly, the motion weary. “I don’t know what name to give it. Only that we ran. The rest…” His gaze returned to Mireth, whose breathing was steady now though her eyes remained shut. “The rest is ashes.”

Outside, the wind pressed against the shutters, sleet ticking softly at the glass. Renna finished with his gloves, set them by the stove, and brought another blanket to lay over his legs.

Meed lowered his voice further. “You’re safe enough here, for what that’s worth. No one about for a good few miles, and none will come calling in this weather. But if there’s more of them—more of whoever did this—should I be watching the fences? Are you followed?”

Brenden hesitated. “I think there were none left to follow.” He paused, recalling the hollow silence after the ruin, where pursuit should have been. “Not after that flash.”

Meed’s eyes lingered on the ash still smudged into Brenden’s sleeves. “If you wish it, my boys and I can go up the valley,” he said quietly. “Folk ought not be left in the open. We’d see to a resting place. And the stock.”

Brenden’s shook his head and his reply was rough, barely above a whisper. “There’s none left to bury. And nothing left to tend. The fire took it all. Just black earth and stone.” His hand closed into a fist, pressing against his mouth.

Meed’s face darkened, old shadows of loss moving there. “I’d thought the bad times behind us,” he murmured. “But if the tales be true, it’s not the first time light has come down from the hills… nor the first to leave a house empty.” His gaze drifted back to the fire, to Mireth and Wenna, the movements by the hearth now gentle, sure.

He eased himself down beside Brenden, the floor cold through his trousers, boots steaming at the edge of the firelight. “When the time comes,” he said, “you can tell it in your own way. There’s no hurry—so long as you and the woman mend. But I would know, someday, who or what brought this night on you. On us. Your father was a good man and his death is a loss to us all.”

Brenden gave a small nod, unable to speak further. The weight of weariness and grief pulling him down like a stone around his neck. Renna, seeing his struggle, nudged the mug back toward his lips, covering his hands with her own, steady and warm.

The kitchen grew quiet. Wenna and Marra wrapped Mireth in thick quilts, turning her gently so the heat could reach her through and through. Rallin and Joss carried wet boots outside, their voices low as they spoke of firewood and the days chores. The fire roared in the hearth, its light trembling across the stone floor, softening every worn face it touched.

Brenden sat where Meed had left him, knees drawn in, hands hanging loose. The voices in the kitchen were muted, as if the walls had thickened with snow. The cold of the flagstones crept through his clothes, yet he stayed where he was. Smoke lingered in his hair; the smell of scorched wood clung to his sleeves. He had kept his spine straight while there was need, but the weight in his chest had been waiting, pressing upward. His chin sank to his breast, and his shoulders began to curl. The first breath caught on its way out, shaking him once, then again, until his whole frame trembled.

The weeping took him slowly at first, a quiet that broke into ragged sound. His breath stumbled, drew short, and fell away in gasps that left his throat raw. He pressed his palms against his eyes, but the heat behind them spilled freely, tracing its way down over chilled skin. Images came without bidding—his father’s boots by the door, his mother turning a loaf on the table, the sound of the gate-latch in the wind—small things now torn from the living world. The sobs rose and fell until they were only shivers, until the ache in his chest was all that remained.

Gradually the tears lessened and ceased. He sat still, arms folded loosely over his knees, the emptiness in him heavy and unshaped. The fire’s glow reached him but could not touch the hollow it found. His thoughts drifted—over the ruin behind them, over faces that would not be seen again, over the road ahead that he could not yet picture. Somewhere in that distance lay the morning, and whatever was to follow.

Renna spread a blanket for him and he let his eyes close at last. Her voice was a whisper at the edge of sleep: “Rest now. You’re safe.” The heat of the fire pressed in, but the image of the ruin and the thunder over the valley lingered in the dark, curling through his thoughts like the scent of smoke. Even as he drifted down into rest, he kept listening for Mireth’s breathing, hoping for the next morning’s light to bring her fully back.
