Embers in the Snow

Snow clung to the thatched eaves and the narrow ledges of the windows, softening the world in white silence. Beyond the shuttered panes, dawn touched the eastern ridge, brushing the high crowns of the trees with a thin wash of gold. Within the cottage, the hearth crackled gently—its light casting long amber across the low-beamed ceiling and the wool-woven rugs underfoot. A kettle hissed faintly on its iron hook. The air was steeped in woodsmoke and barley porridge, the scent of both carrying the warmth of a place long lived in.

Brenden stirred beneath his quilt, eyes still closed, loath to leave the hush. He knew the weight of new snow without looking—felt it in the softened breath of the morning, in the stillness that pressed lightly upon the eaves. Outside, a sparrow gave a single bright chirp into the silence. With a slow sigh, he pushed back the quilt and set his feet to the floor.

The chill bit sharp—familiar, yet unwelcome. His boots, stiffened in the night by yesterday’s damp, waited by the door. His shirt was no softer, and needed a hard shake against the wall before it would yield to his shoulders. On a stool beside the hearth lay a scarf of coarse goat-wool, his mother’s own knitting; he wound it about his neck and stepped into the kitchen.

Maela was already at her work, sleeves rolled high, humming low as she stirred the pot. Her braid was bound tight, her motions brisk with the day’s purpose.

“You all right?” she asked, eyes on the spoon.

“Slow to wake,” he murmured, rubbing his face with both hands.

“Tired—or hiding from the cold?”

“A bit of both,” he admitted. “Yesterday’s work took more from me than I thought.”

Maela’s nod was slight, the spoon never still. “Did you finish the south line?”

“Near enough. Needs bracing at the far corner—I’ll see to it after the rise.”

“If you can,” she said, firm but mild, “check the posts by the goat slope as well. Ice has worked one loose. I’ll be in the preserves; the salt is turning, and the beets must be done today.”

He gave assent, took the bowl she handed him, and ate quickly—porridge thick with honey and butter. The door opened to the morning, and Eadric came in, snow scattering from his shoulders, his beard rimed white. He laid his armful of logs by the hearth, and with the quiet intent that always preceded work, said:

“Snow’s heavier than yesterday. The north fence needs seeing to.”

Brenden finished the last spoonful, set the bowl aside, and rose. The morning’s rhythm fell into place without thought. Eadric set to sharpening the tools; Maela’s knife clicked steady against the board as she cut the beets into their waiting jars. Brenden cleared yesterday’s ash, drew on his coat, and stepped into winter’s hold.

The air outside was sharp and bright, the snow deep and clean. Fox-tracks wove between the posts. His boots sank with a muted crunch along the path to the shed; behind him the chimney trailed a slow plume of smoke, and from near the barn came the crow of a restless rooster.

Brenden loved the winter—not for its gentleness, but for its truth. The cold stripped away pretence. It bit the skin, kept the body honest, and left no ease for the idle. Summer could be lax with heat and flies; spring, a waiting-ground of mud and melt. But winter spoke plain, bare-limbed and clear-eyed.

He knew its every shade: the brittle crust of old snow beneath a new fall; the heaviness of sky before a storm; the way sound carried truer through the cold—nearer, sharper. Even the aches had meaning. Burning fingers meant the blood still moved; stiff thighs told of honest climb. He trusted winter more than any other season. It made no feint of kindness.

Yet it wore on a man—the damp in boots that never quite dried, the scarf’s breath-ice against the mouth, the kettle slow to boil, and mornings when nothing stirred but the crows. It was the season that reached the bone and asked a reckoning.

Brenden had grown into it as a tree into frost-bound earth. He welcomed the hush it laid over the vale, the long blue shadows at dusk, the crunch underfoot that spoke of work well done. Winter’s hardness made each small warmth a thing earned: a bowl of porridge, a dry pair of socks, the rough-woven scarf at his neck. Even the heft of a hammer sat right in his hand here, in the clean morning light, beneath a sky the colour of polished steel.

He pulled his coat tighter as he reached the shed. The door creaked like an old jaw, and the familiar scent of hay, iron, and dry wood met him like an embrace. He stepped inside, let the cold shut out behind him, and reached for the tools. He gathered them quickly—wire, nails, mallet, fence pliers—then, back out to the cold, began his climb up the slope, intent on finishing repairs by midday. The wood needed to hold, the frost not too deep; then he could return to the warmth indoors.

By the time the sun broke through the overcast, Brenden was halfway up the slope. He worked steadily, jacket open now, hands red from the cold. The wind had died, and a hush had settled over Brannock Vale so complete that even the birds seemed to hold their breath. He reached the broken post and knelt beside it. The wood had split along the grain, frost wedged into its cracks. He braced it, tapped in fresh nails, tightened the wire, straightened the line.

When he rose to stretch, his back stiff and fingers numb, his eyes wandered across the vale below—

and there, far off down the western trail, a rider came into view.

The horse moved slowly, each step sinking deep into the snow, her flanks streaked with foam. The figure in the saddle leaned forward—not so much seated as draped—and for a breath Brenden thought it might be a sack or bundle. But the shape shifted, clinging to the pommel. Whoever it was, they were barely holding on.

He narrowed his eyes into the snow-haze, trying to be sure. The rider was little more than a blur behind a drifting veil, yet there was no mistaking the slump of the shoulders, the faltering sway with each step.

The hammer slipped from his grasp, landing in the snow with a muffled thud, and he broke into a run down the slope. Snow clutched at his boots; cold air scraped his throat; more than once a hidden stone jarred his step. But he did not slow. His breath came sharp—not from fear, but the pull of the climb in reverse—his eyes fixed on the trail where the rider had vanished.

The coil of wire thumped once against his back before slipping loose. He let it fall. The ground dropped away beneath him in long white folds, the dark pines drawing nearer with every stride. Behind him, the broken post leaned at an angle, half-mended and left for another time.

He burst into the yard just as the mare stumbled in. Her head hung low, nostrils flaring with each laboured breath. Sweat darkened her tack; her flanks quivered beneath the weight. The rider swayed dangerously, upright only because one hand was tangled in the reins. As the horse faltered, the cloak drew back, and Brenden caught sight of the dark, stiff stain along her side—blood, frozen black in the cold.

Then the woman slipped sideways, her legs catching in the stirrups, the saddle twisting under her weight. Brenden lunged, his arms locking awkwardly around her ribs before she struck the ground. She sagged against him—taller than him by half a head, heavy with soaked wool and ice.

Her breath came hot and fast against his shoulder. Her lips moved. “They’re coming,” she whispered—faint, but clear enough in the hush. She opened her eyes for a heartbeat—pale blue in the grey light—then closed them again.

“Father!” he called, his voice raw with effort. “Mother!”

The door to the cottage flew open before the words had left his mouth. Eadric and Maela stepped out into the snow, their faces already set.

“Eadric—shoulders,” Maela said. “Brenden, her legs. Quick now. Did she speak?”

“I think… they’re coming.”

Inside, the warmth struck like a wall. Eadric shouldered the door shut behind them. The table cleared in one sweep—jars and glass tumbling to the floor. Maela flung a wool blanket across the boards, and together they lowered the woman onto it. Her head lolled to the side, her limbs giving way entirely.

Brenden pressed back near the hearth, unsure where to place his gaze, as Maela knelt and drew a small knife from her belt. With a practiced motion, she slit the crusted cloak and the layers beneath, parting them to bare the woman’s side.

The tunic peeled away, stiff with frost and soaked black from hip to ribs.

“Blade strike,” Maela said. Her voice was changed—low, measured, and intent. “Clean angle. Deep, but not too deep. Missed the lung by little.”

“She held pressure all the way here,” Eadric added, lowering his hood.

Maela laid her palm gently over the wound, fingers spread. Her lips moved in a murmur. The lines at the corners of her eyes drew tight, and a faint shimmer passed from her hand—a ripple in the air, as though heat rose from stone. The woman’s breath steadied.

“I think she’ll hold,” Maela said, withdrawing her hand. “Brenden—the horse. Get her in the shed. Eadric—water. Boil it, and strip the cot. I want every piece of clean cloth we have.”

Brenden gave a quick nod and was gone.

The mare stood where she had stopped, breath ragged, eyes wide. Ice and foam flecked her coat, the reins hanging loose. She shifted as he neared, but did not shy. Her muscles quivered beneath the dark, sweat-soaked hair, the saddle askew from her fall.

“Easy now,” he said, low and steady, laying a hand against her neck. She was hot to the touch—too hot. Her winter coat was sodden, her breath pluming in harsh bursts. He crouched, unfastening the girth straps with chilled fingers, and eased the saddle away. The blanket beneath it was stiff with frozen blood.

He staggered beneath the weight, heaving both over the fence rail, and turned her toward the shed. She followed willingly, but her steps dragged; twice she stumbled on the packed snow.

Inside, the air was thick with hay and the faint tang of old liniment. She halted just past the threshold, steam rising from her flanks. Brenden led her into the far stall and barred the gate.

Again she swayed, and he caught her shoulder. “Not yet,” he muttered, steadying her.

He found a dry cloth and set to rubbing her down—neck, shoulders, flanks—his hands raw from the cold but unhurried. Steam rose from her hide in twisting curls, vanishing into the rafters. When the worst damp was gone, he covered her with an old wool throw and fetched water. She drank in slow pulls, nostrils flaring, eyes half-closed.

Only when her breathing eased did he step back, pausing at the gate to take one last measure of her—the frost on her fetlocks, the steadying rise of her ribs. Then he shut the shed door behind him and ran for the house.

By the time he returned, the room had altered. The shutters were drawn and barred; chairs stood stacked near the door; the cot frame braced the rear window; a bucket of kindling had been overturned into the hearth. Tools, wax, and folded cloths lay in a neat spread on the floor, and a great pot had begun to steam over the fire.

The woman lay still upon the table, her face pale and drawn, hair damp against her brow. Her lips parted faintly, though no sound came. Her breath was slow, shallow.

Maela bent over her with the bone-curved needle, drawing gut-thread through the raw edges of the wound—pinch, pierce, pull—her hands steady, her eyes never leaving the work. Now and again she dabbed the site with a cloth steeped in clear tincture before setting the needle once more.

Eadric was at the far wall, one hand braced against the baking shelf. A soft click sounded, and a hidden latch gave way. From behind the bricks he drew a long canvas-wrapped bundle, setting it on the bench and untying the cords. Within lay a staff of wardwood, darkened with age, its surface carved with old sigils that faded into the grain. Brenden stared—he had never seen it before, nor known such a space was there.

“Eadric,” Maela said without turning, “the blades.”

He brought a second bundle, smaller, bound in oiled cloth. The knots came apart under his fingers, deliberate and slow. Two blades lay within—slender, crescent-curved, forged of a dark metal that drank the firelight. The grips were wrapped in black leather, worn smooth by long-forgotten hands; fine-lined sigils curled along the flats from hilt to tip.

Maela tied off the last stitch, drew a breath, and set her hands in her lap for a moment. Then she rose, crossed to the blades, and rested her fingers above one hilt before lifting it. The leather settled into her palms as if it belonged there. She turned the weapon once; the edge caught no light. Her gaze followed the sigils along its length, her expression unreadable, but weighted.

She took the second blade, crossed it over the first, held them a moment longer, then laid them down and went to the stairwell. From beneath the lowest tread she drew a leather satchel, unfastened its straps, and set out its contents—chalks white, red, and grey; wax sticks; a bone-sealed vial of blood; a pouch of iron dust; three silver nails bound in ash-thread.

She pushed the hearth rug aside, revealing a wide circle cut into the stone—its runes worn near to nothing. Brenden had lived his whole life above them and never known they were there. She brushed the dust clear, pressed wax and iron into the faint lines, her words low and unbroken. At the last she laid her palm to the circle’s heart and spoke a sharper word.

The air seemed to thicken.

She moved to the windows, painting glyphs in ash and vinegar; to the lintel, where she scratched a sign and sealed it with her blood. A second rug came up to bare the flagstones beneath the main beam; faint markings rose beneath her hand. Iron powder darkened each stroke; another seal flared and faded.

At the eastern post she found a crack in the join, pressed her thumb to it, spoke low, and drove one of the silver nails home. Above the pantry door she set two runes—one like smoke, one angular and clenched—and bound a sprig of burnt sage above them. At the stair’s turning she marked the timbers, whispering between each motion, until her chalks were worn to nubs.

When she was done, the room was changed. Not safe—but held. Taut as a bowstring.

Outside, the wind had stilled, but the cold had sharpened. Snow fell in a slow drift, laying its hush upon the yard.

Eadric knelt beneath the gateway. Brenden watched from the shutter, his brow against the cold wood. His father worked barehanded, skin reddening in the frost, pressing into the earth with patient care. From his belt he drew small, pale stones, no larger than river pebbles, placing each in turn into the hollows he scraped—four in all, one for each corner of the threshold.

He handled them like heirlooms—or offerings—speaking low over each before covering it again.

The last stone took longest; his fingers had grown stiff. When it was done, he drew from his coat a braid of yew bound at either end in tarnished copper, and tied it across the gateway’s beam. The knot was slow, his hands shaking, but the work was sure.

When it was set, he stood beneath it for a time, breath pluming into the still air, snow settling on his hood and collar. He seemed to listen—for something distant and faint. Then, without turning toward the house, he walked down the side path and was gone.

Brenden stayed at the shutter a moment longer, his fingers curled hard against the frame. The yard lay still once more beneath its weight of snow. He turned, slid down with his back to the wall. This had always been a place of warmth and woodsmoke, of porridge in the mornings and tools in the shed. Now it was a held fortress—its quiet drawn taut with signs and hidden weapons. The people he called parents moved like soldiers, like keepers of old rites, their calm before violence colder than the air outside.

A tightness rose in his chest; the edges of his sight blurred. He pushed to his feet, stumbled to the corner behind the hearth, and bent forward, retching into the ash. The taste of bile stung his throat. When it passed, he wiped his mouth on his sleeve and straightened, still unsteady.

Maela was beside him at once. She cupped his cheek, drew his brow down to hers. “We are in danger,” she said softly, “and there is likely to be a fight. You listen for my orders, and you stay down. And if it turns, and I tell you to run—you run. No matter what happens.”

Brenden swallowed against the rawness in his throat. “Who is she?”

Maela’s pause was brief. “Her name is Mireth,” she said. “She is a friend.”

The door opened and Eadric stepped in, snow sliding from his sleeves. His boots left dark, wet prints across the floor. “The gateway is rigged,” he said, voice low. “Trip-stones under the arch—marked and set. More buried along the north path, the woodline, and both fence corners.”

An hour passed in slow silence.

Eadric sat near the door, his staff laid across his knees, thumb tracing the worn line of a sigil without thought. The rhythm of it steadied him, as it had in younger days when the nights were longer and the stakes no lighter. His gaze roamed the shuttered walls, measuring where the first breach might come, where the footing would hold, where it would fail. Outside, the wind rose and fell against the timbers, and he listened—not to the storm itself, but to the changes beneath it, the faint disturbances in its sway.

In the deep of his chest, he felt the old weight return—the quiet before steel meets steel, when a man sets his mind to the work ahead. He flexed his hands once, feeling the dull ache in the knuckles, and breathed slow, keeping his thoughts to the ground beneath him, to the faces he must protect.

At the hearth, Maela worked with deliberate care, though much of the true labour was within. She checked and rechecked the edges of her work—the sealed runes, the lines of iron dust, the hidden points she alone knew to guard. Her fingers moved with the precision of a weaver setting the last threads, yet her mind was on the measure of the fight. How long the wards might hold. How much strength she could spend before the body failed her.

She poured water into a small cup, not because she thirsted, but because her voice would need steadiness for the words to come. The taste was cold and flat on her tongue. For a while she stood by the shutter, feeling the air along its seam, counting the heartbeats between each change in the draught. In the kitchen corner, her satchel waited open, each vial and bundle placed for quick taking.

Their eyes met only once in that hour. No word passed. Eadric’s hand settled on the staff; Maela’s on the curve of her blade. Both knew the weight of what might be asked before the night was done.

Mireth stirred as the last of the light faded. Her breath caught once, then steadied. Eyes opened, blinked against the fire’s shifting glow. She winced, turned her head slightly, and found Maela. Her lips parted. “Eadric. Maela.” The words were rough, cracked with dryness, but her gaze was clear. “You’re still alive.”

Maela crouched, one hand on her shoulder. “Still here—though not expecting you.”

“Sorry we couldn’t send word. None of the others made it?”

Eadric came forward, staff in hand, his eyes fixed on hers. “Who was with you?”

“Tennor. Lysa. We came down from Glenfold three weeks past. Rohen sent us—there was word you’d been found out, hunted again. We watched their movements; when it became certain they were closing in, we came to warn you.”

Maela’s jaw tightened. “What happened?”

“We took the high trail over Windfall Ridge. Snow slowed us more than it should have. We thought ourselves clear.” She shifted, her fingers brushing the bandage at her side. “One of them caught me in the lower pass. Blade under the ribs—clean cut, deep. I held it closed as best I could.”

“You kept pressure on it the whole way? Likely saved your life,” Maela said.

Mireth nodded once. “Near enough. Lost them in the valley bend after. Don’t think they saw which fork I took—but they’ll know by now you’re in Brannock. They’ve been questioning farmers up and down the vale. Wish I’d come in better shape.”

“You brought warning,” Maela said. “Better than being caught blind.”

She sat back on her heels, glancing toward the shuttered window where night had gathered.

Mireth eased herself up on one elbow. Pain flickered across her face, but her voice was steady. “What now?”

There was a pause.

“We’ve one horse,” Maela said. “No packs ready. Brenden’s never slept rough a night in his life. The ridge trail is open ground—nearly a mile without cover.”

“We’d be slow,” Eadric added. “We will not outrun them. We hold here.”

Mireth’s gaze fell. Her hands clenched and eased. She leaned back, the ghost of a smile touching her mouth. “Well. Have you anything left for the pain?”

Maela fetched a small clay vial from the satchel, pulled the stopper, and handed it to her. Mireth drank without a flinch.

For a time, the firelight played across her hair. Then she rose slowly, steadying herself with one hand, and reached for the blade that had been laid beside her. Maela met her eyes and gave a short nod; Eadric did the same without a word. He crossed to the window and tightened the shutter bolts. Maela opened the satchel on the floor once more.

Brenden stayed by the wall. Another hour bled away. Beyond the shutters, the valley lay dark under a rising half-moon. He stood unmoving, fear held tight beneath his ribs. His parents were no longer only his parents—they were something more, something other, with blades and secrets, and a quiet readiness for blood.

Outside, the wind had risen again. It pushed through the gateway with a breath that carried more than cold. It brought fear. And beneath it—faint at first, then certain—the steady drum of hoofbeats, climbing through the frozen earth in measured time.

“They’re coming,” Eadric said.

He stood in the doorway, his back to them all—then ran into the yard, passed beneath the gateway, and vanished into the dark.
