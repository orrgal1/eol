First Blood

Brenden crouched low beside the door, his shoulder pressed to the cold stone, the faint grain of it rough against his sleeve. Breath slipped from him in pale clouds, each one blooming upon the shutterpane, fading, and returning again. Across the frame, Maela stood silent—eyes narrowed, hands poised above the latch, her whole form drawn taut as a bowstring, listening. Behind them, the hearth’s embers pulsed in the gloom, their glow breathing a slow, steady warmth into the wool-woven rugs. From the back hatch, Mireth kept her watch, one hand clenched about the iron latch, her gaze fixed far into the dark.

The hoofbeats began as a whisper beneath the wind. At first only a tremor, they swelled into a steady drum, rolling through the valley until the very stones beneath the cottage seemed to quiver. Brenden’s fingers tightened on the sill. A strange stillness gathered in him—not the stillness of calm, but the bracing pause before a wave strikes. His heart rose to match the rhythm outside, quicker now, until he felt its pulse in his ears.

This was no dream of danger, no shadow at the edge of thought. The blood, the fire’s low breath, the silence that thickened with every heartbeat—all were threads in the same vast weaving, drawing toward a single, crashing moment. His hands trembled on the wood.

“Brenden.”

His mother’s voice came sharp but quiet. “Down.”

He obeyed at once. As he dropped, a sharp crack split the night—loud enough to shake the shutters in their frames. Another followed, closer, like a giant’s hand breaking stone.

Then came the blast.

It struck him square in the chest, a force that tore the breath from his lungs and drove his shoulder hard into the doorframe. His eyes clamped shut; every muscle shrank against the heat and shock. For a few heartbeats he was nothing but noise and light, the pounding of his blood and the roaring silence that followed. A silence that must only have existed inside his head as the world outside was tearing itself apart.

Somewhere in that silence, where the only sound was that of his own heartbeats, a horse screamed.

The cry tore him back. His hands clawed at the sill; he dragged his gaze to the narrow seam in the shutters.

The yard was a maelstrom.

Snow burst upward in white arcs beneath thrashing hooves. Two of the lead horses had fallen—one kicking wildly, the other sprawled with its neck bent at a dreadful angle. Riders were flung into the churned drifts, scrambling for their weapons. One, half-risen, reached for the sword across his back—

And Eadric was among them.

He came from the shadow of the trees just past the gate—staff low, cloak trailing, his steps light as falling ash. For a breath, he was no more than a shadow moving through fire and frost. Then he stepped into the open—and struck.

The first fallen rider had almost found his feet when Eadric’s staff swept hard across his throat. The sound was wet and final. The man folded, limbs slack as cloth. The second turned at the noise, but the staff’s butt drove deep into his gut before he could lift his blade. His breath left him in a strangled gasp; his body crumpled into the snow.

A sharp, guttural call broke from one of the three who remained. They dismounted in a single motion, fanning wide, boots crunching in the churn. Their blades caught the faint firelight as they angled toward the cottage.

Eadric stepped back, slow and measured, drawing them from the gate. His stance lowered—knees bent, staff raised across his chest—and his lips moved in a whisper.

The staff began to glow.

Not with flame, but with light—first a pale blue seeping from the runes along its length, then deepening, burning, until it shone like white-hot iron. Snow hissed beneath it; his breath steamed brighter in the cold.

---

The three halted—only for the space of a breath, yet long enough for Brenden to see them clearly for the first time.

Their cloaks were alike: black wool, stiff with old dust and patched at the elbows. Hoods shadowed most of their faces, but what the moon revealed was pale and hard, the skin weathered by long roads and older wounds. One—broad of shoulder, a jagged scar climbing from his jaw—held a sword whose fuller glimmered with a deep, embered red, like heat had been forged into its very heart. It hummed faintly, a taut, dangerous note against the stillness.

Then they moved—together, swift as a breaking tide.

The scarred one, red blade forward, drove straight for Eadric. The other two cut wide, seeking the door—only to be met by Maela.

She leapt from the step, a dark blur of wool and steel. Both blades were drawn, black as wet slate, their edges catching only the thinnest thread of firelight. Snow tangled in her skirts, her braid snapped behind her, and her right-hand blade slid upward beneath the first man’s ribs before his weapon could find her. He sagged, knees folding, and was gone from her path. She turned without pause, meeting the second with a clash of steel—a shriek and a spark. Her left blade caught his guard high; the right slipped into the narrow gap beneath his arm. A twist, a pull—his cry broke into a gurgle as he fell.

Eadric and the scarred man circled one another. The red sword’s glow deepened, staining the snow with a dull crimson. The runes along Eadric’s staff burned white in answer, their heat drawing steam from the drifts beneath his feet.

The first cut came quick—a flat sweep toward Eadric’s ribs. He shifted, just enough; cloth tore where the edge caught a thread from his coat. A second blow fell, heavier, for the hollow of his shoulder. Eadric caught it on the haft, both hands braced, and wrenched the blade aside, driving it into the snow with a hiss of steel on ice.

The scarred man lunged, the red edge rising. Eadric gave ground, his boots sure upon the crusted snow, and turned the retreat into a strike—his staff swept in a tight arc and smashed into the man’s wrist. The sword wavered. In the same breath, Eadric spun, reversed his grip, and drove the staff into the attacker’s shoulder. The man staggered sideways, his mouth twisted in pain. Where the staff moved, white light trailed behind, bright and thin as breath drawn in frost.

The man came on again, heedless of the bodies cooling at his back. Eadric stepped into him—not with fury, but with a cold and measured will—and thrust the staff forward, both hands at its butt.

The blow struck true. A spear of white light pierced through the man’s chest and out his back. The sound of it was wrong—like stone splitting in frost, or timber giving way under the axe. His body jerked once, then stilled; his mouth opened, but no word came. The red sword slipped from his hand, its weight biting softly into the snow. Smoke curled from the wound, heavy with the bitter scent of burnt iron and flesh. He fell to his knees, and then to the drift, unmoving.

---

For a breath, the world held itself apart. Only the wind moved.

It whispered through the broken gate and over the bodies sprawled like cast-off garments upon the snow. Near the stone posts, a wounded horse shuddered, breath rasping from its lungs in thick white plumes. Blood soaked the flank where fire had torn through flesh—thick and black now, crusting at the edges. With each wheezing exhale, the steam mingled with the snowfall, rising in pale ghosts before vanishing into the dark.

The yard bore the marks of struggle—hoofprints churned to slush, weapons half-buried where they had fallen, the twisted remnants of cloaks clinging to broken limbs. Blood ran in slow, branching streams, staining the frost in deep, rust-dark veins. Already the snow began to claim them, laying its shroud upon steel and skin alike. No hand moved to bury the dead. No breath stirred the fallen. Only the wind passed on, cold and tireless.

Brenden gripped the sill until his fingers ached. His knuckles shone white in the firelight, though he scarcely felt them. The air that crept through the shutter’s seam was sharp with iron and ash, with the scorched stench of singed wool—and beneath it, something fouler, a scent that clung to the back of the throat like rot in a closed room.

His breath caught high, shallow and raw. The world beyond the shutter was a frozen hush, yet something in him would not be still. His ribs pressed inward; his chest had narrowed. His sight blurred at the edges, dimming at the corners and pulsing in time with his heart. He did not understand what it was that clawed its way up through him—only that it was vast and cold and rising.

In the yard, Maela stood with her braid fallen loose, strands of it dark with melted snow. The twin blades hung heavy at her sides. Eadric’s staff still burned, but faintly, the runes along its shaft dimming with each breath. They stood amidst the dead, ringed by silence and steam, their breath curling like smoke in the still air. The firelight from within spilled across the threshold and no further—beyond that, the snow swallowed all.

Maela turned her head slightly. “Inside?” she murmured, her voice no louder than the wind.

Eadric lifted his hand, palm open, and held it there. A stillness took him. His head inclined, and his jaw set tight beneath the beard. For a long moment, there was no reply.

Then it changed.

Beneath the silence, a pressure began—not sound, but weight, rising through the earth. The ground seemed to stiffen beneath Brenden’s boots. It was as though the world held its breath—but not in peace. In dread.

A beat.

Then another.

Not five. More.

Hoofbeats.

Heavy.

Many.

Distant still, but growing—like a wall of stormclouds advancing through snow, unseen but certain.

Eadric spoke, not looking back. His voice was low, shaped from cold iron. “That was only the vanguard.”

He turned, cloak trailing, and ran for the house. Maela followed, blades dark in her hands, her boots striking sparks from the frozen path.

Brenden stumbled back from the shutter, the heat of the room striking him like the walls had closed in. His breath came too fast, drawn in through clenched teeth. The firelight danced too bright across the timber.

He pressed himself to the wall beside the door, heartbeat roaring in his ears, knuckles knocking against the frame in a rhythm not his own. He could feel something bracing inside him—some old instinct, unnamed and wild, coiling tight behind the ribs.

He swallowed hard. His hands clenched.

And when the door burst open—when Maela crossed the threshold, her eyes scanning the room, her blade trailing smoke—Brenden moved without thinking.

He sprang up, reached for the iron bar, and threw it down across the latch with a sharp, final clack that echoed in the beams.

Behind it, the night howled.

The riders came swiftly, their approach pounding the frozen earth.

Eadric kept to the hatch by the front shutter, one eye fixed to the narrow slit in the timber. Wind drove thin skeins of snow across the frame, whispering restlessly. Below, in the yard, the fallen lay scattered—some sprawled where they had dropped, others half-buried by the growing drifts. Smoke coiled upward from a scorched patch where the last of the vanguard had met the staff’s fire.

The newcomers reined in at the gate with the discipline of soldiers. Ten in number, their cloaks hung heavy with thawing snow, their armour dulled and streaked from the road. Bare blades rested across their saddlebows, catching only a dim glimmer from the half-moon. Horse-breath streamed out in long white ropes, wreathing the line in ghostly vapour. No voice called. Only leather creaked and hooves crunched softly.

For two breaths they sat so—ten still figures in silver light—then moved as one, swinging down.

Snow swallowed the sound of their landing, yet Eadric heard the muffled thuds, the buckles clinking low, the grunt of men stretching stiff legs. Four dropped behind the short brick walls flanking the gate. The rest split at once—three slipping into the narrow stand of trees to the left, three more angling wide through the brush. Shadows closed around them, and they were gone.

“Flanking,” Eadric murmured, scarcely louder than the wind.

Maela stood at the centre of the room, eyes half-lidded, arms raised. Her palms glimmered with a faint gold-blue sheen; fine strands of that light stretched outward from her fingers, knitting into the runes carved in beam, stone, and lintel. The air trembled, a slow, thrumming pulse that seemed to bind the house’s bones together.

Eadric moved quickly, silent as a man long-practised in battle. He gathered his staff and a small bundle from beneath the stairs. A glance toward Brenden—brief, unreadable—held something between warning and reassurance.

“Stay by the shutter,” he said, his voice a low rasp. “Do not open it. Whatever comes, keep low.”

Brenden nodded, throat tight, and slid behind the rear shutter, crouching low against the stone. The house felt smaller now, its air drawn close by tension and the tang of magic. Mireth emerged from the cellar door, pale-faced, a sword in her hand. She limped across the floor to meet Eadric, their eyes locking for an instant without words. She passed him and vanished again down the steps, boots silent on the worn planks.

The air stilled, save for the hearth’s faint crackle and Maela’s even breath as she fed light into the warding lines. Beyond the walls, the wind pressed. Brenden crouched, senses drawn taut as wire. The cellar door closed with a dull, final thud.

He kept his palm to the shutter, eyes fixed on the seam of moonlight, heart counting each pulse in the wards.

Then the hum began.

It was faint at first, a tremor through the floor like wind along a taut string. It deepened, pressing upward from the stone into his boots. Maela’s hands stiffened, the veins at her wrists standing out as she poured more of herself into the runes. Sparks leapt along the carved lines at the threshold. Outside, a voice began to chant—low, measured—then another, then a third, the sound threading around the house until it formed a circle of tone and threat.

The first blow came without warning.

A blast struck hard against the western shutter—orange light bled through the seams in jagged veins, then a concussion slammed into the walls, rattling the floor beneath Brenden’s knees. Dust leapt from the rafters and rained down in fine gray streams. The shutter groaned inward but did not break.

A second explosion cracked against the rear beam. The stone shuddered; the wooden post splintered. In the corner, an old shelf buckled with a groan, its legs twisting. Glass jars clattered across the boards—some rolled, one struck the floor and shattered, sending the scent of dried herbs into the heavy air.

Then came the lightning.

It speared through the narrow slats to the right, a whip of white-blue fire that left no wound, but laced the air with a searing charge. Brenden’s teeth ached with it. The wards flared in response—gold light snapping into the carved runes along beam and lintel, flaring bright for a breath before sputtering like a candle in wind.

Maela stood unmoved in the center of the room, though sweat gleamed along her brow. Her arms were still raised, her hands alight with that same gold-blue shimmer, but now the light flickered—less steady, less certain. Her breath came slow, but no longer easy.

The attack did not relent.

More strikes fell—some sharp and clean as hammer-blows on iron, others wide and bludgeoning, like the swing of something vast and unseen. Each one struck from a different angle, testing the bones of the house. Rafters creaked overhead. Floorboards moaned.

Dust spun madly in the ward-light, a swarm of grey motes caught in a rising wind. Iron pots swung from their hooks and clanged against the hearth stones. A stack of clay bowls toppled from the counter and shattered one by one, their edges skittering away beneath the table. A tin ladle spun across the stones, striking sparks as it bounced.

From the far side, fire lashed across the outer wall. Flame painted the interior red through the seams before vanishing. A moment later, something struck from above—a great, concussive weight that set the rafters quivering and loosed a second wave of dust and grit.

Maela’s voice broke through it all—sharp, clipped syllables in a tongue Brenden did not know. She poured them into the air like nails driven into wood. The wards pulsed in answer. New runes flared along the doorframe, but some sparked weakly, others guttered out entirely, their carved channels unable to hold the power drawn into them.

Her arms shook. The shimmer frayed at the edges.

Then came the blow that broke the rhythm.

A strike hammered into the front corner beam—so sudden and close that Brenden didn’t hear it so much as feel it. The world tilted.

He was thrown sideways, his crouch lost, the breath knocked from him in a hard grunt. His ribs struck stone. His cheek hit wood. For a moment, there was only grit in his teeth, fire behind his eyes, and dust thick in his mouth.

He clawed himself upright, coughing, chest burning. His hands fumbled for the sill, dragging him toward the shutter.

And through a gap—narrow and splintered—he looked out.

---

Two figures had taken position just beyond the broken gate, framed by the jagged remnants of the wall and the bodies strewn in snow. They stood still as stones, cloaked and hooded, their faces lost to shadow, their breath hidden, if they drew breath at all.

Each held a stave before them—tall, blackened things etched with crawling lines that pulsed faintly like veins beneath skin. Between their hands, threads of red light began to stretch and coil, slow at first, then with greater purpose, summoned from the marrow of the earth. The threads twisted inward, feeding upon each other, thickening into a single sphere of molten power—slow-turning, heavy with intent.

It gave off no flame, yet the air around it shimmered, the cold itself bending back from its heat. Brenden felt it, even behind the shutter—the warmth of it unnatural and wrong, pressing against the boards, seeping into the cracks. The breath in his throat caught. His skin prickled. The hairs on his arms lifted.

It was not fire like that of the hearth or forge. It was fire twisted through will—held too long, shaped too tightly, made to serve what it was never meant to serve.

And it was rising.

“Mother! At the gate!” Brenden shouted, his voice ragged with dust and fear.

Maela turned at once, jaw set. Her gaze flicked to the front shutter, and without hesitation, she shifted her stance. The glow between her palms flared brighter as she poured light into the warding lines etched along the main wall. Runes kindled across the timber, burning gold—but weaker than before. Their light guttered at the edges, struggling to hold.

Outside, the chanting rose to a crescendo. Low voices, layered and cold, wove together in a final cadence. The sound pressed against the stones like a storm wind gathering behind a sealed door.

Then the world tore open.

A sphere of red fire burst from the enemy’s hands—ripping loose with a sound like the sky breaking. It shot forward, swelling as it came, the air around it bending, warping, like the weight of the magic within it pulled the very world askew. Shadows flared in wild shapes across the walls. The boards beneath Brenden’s feet shuddered with each heartbeat.

And from the left, a streak of white cleaved the dark—

—cutting across the yard in a blur of light too sharp for the eye to follow.

Then the flash came.

A great arc of white light rose upward—silent, sudden, immense. It curved into a dome above the house, smooth and seamless, its surface pulsing faintly like the skin of some living thing. The snowfall halted as it passed through, each flake evaporating with a hiss. The air bent around its curve.

The red fire met it head-on.

The collision bloomed without sound—no roar, no shatter, only a pressure that pushed at the bones. The red flame writhed, pressing outward, licking along the curve of the dome like oil on water. It clawed for a way through, sparks leaping like insects caught in a jar. The white held.

For a single breath, the world paused—caught between the two lights.

Then the red broke.

The fire split, unable to push forward, its rage spilling outward in a wide, howling arc. It struck the beams above with a shriek of splintering timber. Wood shattered. The rafters groaned once, then tore free in a thunder of snow and ash.

The loft gave way.

Half the roof collapsed inward. Timbers fell like spears. Smoke and soot and old straw burst into the air. Snow poured through the ruined beams in a sweeping, blinding fall.

Brenden was thrown flat. His ears rang. Smoke clawed into his lungs, hot and bitter. All sound blurred into a rushing roar. He pressed himself against the floor, coughing, eyes squeezed shut against the grit that filled the air.

And through that storm of ruin—through smoke and drifting ash and the thin white veil of falling snow—

—a figure stepped to bar the doorway.

Boots, blackened with ash, sank into scorched snow. A staff was planted before him, its iron tip buried deep into slush that steamed where it met the heat.

Eadric.

He stood beneath the broken lintel, framed by ruin, and he was aflame.

Not with fire that consumes, but with fire that endures.  
A white flame.  
Silent.  
Steady.  
Alive.

It rose from his shoulders in curling tendrils, flickering across his back, licking upward through the strands of his hair like windblown silk. Thin wisps of light coiled from his fingers and cloak-edges, ghostlike and slow, drifting upward and vanishing into the rafters above. The snow that fell upon him vanished before it touched his skin.

The runes carved along his staff glowed brighter now—no longer a soft glimmer, but searing-white lines etched in fire. They pulsed in rhythm with his breath.

His cloak smoked at the edges. One sleeve had been burned away entirely, and the flesh of his arm beneath was raw, blistered, red to the bone in places. Blood slicked the back of his hand. Yet still he stood, unmoving.  
Unbowed.

His chest rose with slow, deliberate rhythm. His jaw was set. His gaze fixed forward through the fire and wreckage as though the night itself were dared to cross him.

And in that moment, as the wind blew cold through the shattered walls, Brenden saw not his father—  
—but a figure out of legend.  
An old power, walked again.  
White flame in the snow.

---

Eadric strode toward the gate, the ruined threshold behind him wreathed in falling ash and snow. White fire streamed in ribbons from his shoulders and staff, trailing in slow arcs behind each step. The ground hissed beneath his boots. From the trees, a bolt of lightning tore across the yard—bright, jagged, shrieking toward his chest. It struck the white aura and shattered, dissipating into harmless sparks that danced around him like fireflies caught in a storm.

Another attacker, cloaked and crouched behind the broken brick wall, rose and cast a web of binding shadow—threaded magic, dark and oily, meant to snare his limbs and twist his balance. The strands reached for Eadric like a living thing. But before they could touch him, the white fire flared outward, and the web ignited midair. It burned away with a high-pitched hiss, the caster recoiling, raising a blade too slowly.

Eadric did not slow. He reached the wall, stepped into the man’s strike, and swept his staff low. The iron-shod end caught the attacker’s shin with a sharp crack. Bone shattered; the man screamed and fell, dropping his weapon to clutch at his leg. Eadric did not pause. The white flame flared along the arc of the staff, and as he passed, it swept over the man’s torso in a smooth curve. The cloak caught first—then flesh. For a breath, the attacker was outlined in brilliant light. Then he collapsed, still and steaming, his cry swallowed by the snow.

A second rose from the far side of the path—a duelist by his stance, blade already drawn, feet planted in a tight, ready posture. He moved quickly, angling behind Eadric, and slashed across his ribs. The cut found flesh. The fabric of Eadric’s coat tore, blood darkened the cloth, and his body twisted under the blow. But he turned into the pain, not away from it. His free hand caught the man’s wrist mid-motion, gripping hard. With a sudden wrench, he twisted the blade away and drove the staff up beneath the attacker’s arm, snapping it at the elbow. The man’s knees gave. Eadric brought the staff down hard across his temple—  
and the body slumped sideways into the snow, limbs limp, blade still trembling where it had fallen.

A third stepped forward at the edge of the clearing, already chanting, both hands outstretched. Crimson light bled between his fingers—sharp, shardlike—forming a clustered volley of pointed spells that shimmered with kinetic heat. With a cry, he loosed them toward Eadric’s heart. They screamed through the air—shards of ruptured magic—twisting as they flew. Eadric lifted his staff with both hands and swept it in a wide arc before him. A shield flared—pure white, thin as glass and curved like the edge of a bowl. The shards struck, scattered, and dissolved into mist without sound. Before the caster could summon again, Eadric lunged forward and drove the staff straight into his chest. The impact lifted the man from the ground. White light burst from his back, flashing like a beacon. His mouth opened and his face contorted in a silent scream. Then he crumpled, smoke rising from the rent in his robe where the light had passed through.

From the far right, one final figure charged. The flame had unnerved him, but not broken him. His face twisted with fury, cloak drawn tight, sword raised high. He shouted something guttural, lost in the wind. Eadric turned just as the man reached him. Their blades clashed once—steel against runed wood—and the attacker forced forward, driving Eadric back a pace. But the white flame surged then, coiling up the staff, spilling from Eadric’s hands, licking over his shoulders. He dropped low, turned the staff sideways, and swept it upward in a wide, ascending arc. The flame followed. It erupted in a fountain of light—cold and fierce. The attacker screamed as the fire struck him, and in an instant, he was gone. Not slain, but erased from existence in a flash of flame. Only ash remained, settling into the churned snow like the last breath of a fire long buried.

The roar came first—deep, grinding, the voice of stone and timber torn asunder. The far wall bowed inward. Mortar split with a sharp crack; a support beam sheared in two. Snow and smoke rushed through the gap a heartbeat before the rest of the wall gave way in a single, shuddering collapse.

Mireth and another figure came flying through the breach with the debris, thrown by some unseen hand. She hit the floor on her shoulder, sliding through splinters and ash. She managed to turn the slide into a roll and got to her feet, blade held ready, dripping with fresh blood. The other figure lay motionless.

His comrades followed.

Three figures stepped through the ruin—tall, in dark mail streaked with frost and ash. No haste in them, only the slow certainty of wolves who have already run their prey to ground. Each held a blade in the same low, angled grip—worn steel, honed thin.

Maela moved to meet them. Her boots slid once on the ash-slick boards before she found her stance. The glow in her hands trembled, dimmed, then steadied to a hard, cold light. Her shoulders sagged, but her gaze did not waver.

The first came on fast, sword rising. She caught his cut on the flat of her blade, the shock of it ringing in the frame of her arms. With a twist and a low step, she drove her point into the joint of his cuirass. The steel slid between links; the man choked, his blade clattering from numb fingers. She wrenched hers free and turned before his body hit the floor.

The second veered for Mireth. His blade swept down, aiming to split her guard. She slid aside, letting the cut pass, and in the same breath stepped in, her own sword rising in a tight, ascending arc. Steel met bone with a sound more felt than heard. The man dropped to one knee; she brought the blade around and found the side of his neck.

The third moved as the others fell—quicker, more deliberate. He passed Maela’s blade with a deft sidestep, his own edge turning hers aside. A boot struck her knee; her guard dipped. He slid under it and drove his sword in low. The steel slipped beneath her ribs.

Her breath burst in a short, wet gasp. She staggered back, the glow in her hands guttering out like a winded candle. The point withdrew with a sound lost in the noise of battle, and her knees folded beneath her. She went down among the wreckage of the wall, shards of ice clinging to her braid.

Mireth’s cry was sharp as she turned. Her sword snapped high in both hands; the man met it with a block, but she pressed, forcing him back step by step. Then she broke the bind, twisted her wrists, and the next cut slid past his guard. He jerked once and stilled.

She let him fall without looking down, dropping beside Maela, hands already pressing against the wound. Blood welled through her fingers, warm against the winter air pouring through the breach.

---

Eadric strode in through the breach—boots sinking into the blackened slush, staff braced in both hands. White fire crowned him, brighter than any ward-light had shone that night. His cloak smoked at the edges; his sleeve hung in charred ribbons, and beneath it the flesh of his arm was seared near to the bone. Up close, Brenden saw what he had never seen before—Eadric’s eyes themselves burning with the same white fire, their light steady and terrible.

He crossed the ruin in three long strides and knelt beside Maela. Steam curled from his sleeve as he set both hands to her belly, over the wound. The white fire sank from his crown and poured into her in a slow, steady glow. Her breath, ragged and shallow, eased; the colour returned faintly to her cheeks. Yet even as it flowed into her, Brenden saw the cost—Eadric’s shoulders bowing, his own breath deepening, as though each draw upon the flame was drawn also from his life. When he pulled his hands away, the glow about her dimmed but held.

---

The wind shifted.

It came thin from the north, sharp as a knife, curling through the jagged breach in the wall. Smoke bent toward it; the last embers in the hearth guttered, their light thinning to ash. Even the snow seemed to fall more slowly, drifting sideways like the air itself bowed to some heavier pull.

Somewhere beyond the gate, hooves struck the frozen ground—slow, unhurried, each step a weight felt in the chest before it reached the ear. Not the scatter and rush of pursuit, not the pounding rhythm of a charge. This was the tread of one who need not hasten, whose coming was certain as the tide.

The horse came into sight first—a great black roan, its coat darkened further by frost, its breath clouding in long, slow plumes. It bore no saddlecloth, only a plain black saddle of old leather, worn smooth at the pommel. At its side hung a length of chain, each link thick as a man’s thumb, clinking softly as it walked.

The rider did not dismount at once. He sat the horse as if carved from the same dark wood as the saddle, head slightly bowed beneath the shadow of his hood. In one gloved hand, a staff rested upright, its head a slow-burning knot of red fire. The light it cast was evil and overbearing. The glow of iron in a forge—deep, sullen, heavy with heat.

When he did move, it was without hurry. One long leg swung down; the boots touched the snow without sound. The chain swayed once and was still.

The hood fell back.

His skin was pale as frost left too long in shade, not the softness of snow but the hard pallor of something carved and left to weather. His hair, black as crows’ wings, was bound close to his head by a strip of blood-red cloth. At his temples, faint lines traced outward like cracks in ice. His ears were sharply tapered, the points just catching the red light of the staff.

But the eyes—black, utterly, like the pupil had devoured the iris and the whites alike—drank in the world and returned nothing. No reflection shone there, no glint of fire or moonlight. Looking into them was like leaning over a deep, dry well, knowing the bottom would never answer back.

He stepped forward. The snow did not crunch beneath his boots. The chain at his side barely stirred. Yet with each pace the air grew heavier, pressing against the ribs, drawing a faint ache to the teeth.

Eadric moved to meet him, stepping over the body of a fallen enemy without looking down. He planted the butt of his staff in the churned slush, the white flame along its length rising a hand’s breadth higher.

“Mireth,” he said, his voice iron in the stillness. “Can you stand?”

She rose, blood on her hands, her breath uneven. “Aye.”

“Take Brenden,” Eadric said. There was no weight on the word *take*, but it bound the air all the same. “Flee.”

The dark one’s gaze shifted to the boy, lingering only long enough for Brenden to feel as though the air had left the room. Then he looked back to Eadric, and the red fire of his staff burned higher.

The wind dropped away. Only the snow moved, drifting in slow spirals between them.
