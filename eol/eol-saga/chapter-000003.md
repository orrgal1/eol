# Angel of Death

The snow drifted in through the splintered wall—pale, unhurried—settling upon the cracked stones where Maela lay. Her tunic was dark with blood, the wound hidden beneath her hand; each breath came quick and shallow between clenched teeth.

Brenden knelt beside her, close enough that his shadow fell over her face, trying to nearness alone might anchor her to the world. Beyond the broken threshold, Eadric stood—staff braced in both hands, shoulders squared beneath a torn cloak, his face half-veiled by firelight and snow. He did not turn nor speak, but held his ground as one who bars the way to all the night’s terrors.

The words he had spoken still hung between them, heavy and undeniable: Take Brenden. Flee.

Brenden looked from the unyielding set of his father’s back to the pallor of his mother’s face, searching for some sign—some reprieve yet unspoken. But Eadric did not move, and the wind tugged at his cloak, and there came no other word.

He bent to Maela, voice trembling. “We can still save you,” he whispered, the plea raw in his throat. “Let me lift you—Mireth and I together. Father will come back. He will—”


She shook her head, a small, weary motion. Her blood-slick fingers found his, closing with what strength remained.

“You must go,” she said. Her voice was rough, but it did not waver. “That is the only help left.”

He searched her gaze for defiance, for comfort—anything to hold—but found only the steady truth of her resolve. “No. We can wait—until the bleeding stops. Mireth will help me. I will carry you. I will…”

Her head moved again, slower this time, her eyes drifting out of focus. “That is not your burden, Brenden. Not now. Not with what comes.”

He tried to rise, but her grip held him fast. “Father will win,” he said, like willing it aloud might make it so. “I saw him before—he has the staff, and the—”

“Perhaps he will,” a faint curve touched her lips, something between sorrow and pride. “Your father knows the cost. He knew it before he spoke. Let him bear what is his to bear.”

Mireth was there beside them, kneeling in silence, her hair fallen loose across her face, her nearness a quiet shape of grief and urgency.

Brenden’s chest ached. He bowed until his brow nearly touched his mother’s. “I cannot leave you.”

Her breath stirred his cheek, faint and uneven. “You must.” The words were not a plea but an ancient truth, spoken like from somewhere beyond the moment. “My time is nearly spent. Yours is not.”

He had no answer—only the salt sting in his eyes and the hollow ache in his throat.

Her hand rose, trembling, to cup his face, her thumb brushing a streak of ash from his cheek. “This day was always waiting for us. We built this home knowing it would end. What matters now is that you survive it.”

For a time there was no sound but her breathing and the slow whisper of falling snow.

“Live,” she said at last, her thumb tracing the curve of his cheek trying to fixing the memory of him in her mind. “Let that be enough.”

He shut his eyes for a moment and felt her touch—cold, yet steady—holding him to a world already slipping from her grasp.

“We shall meet again?” The question was small in his mouth, almost childish, yet he could not swallow it.

Her gaze did not falter. “Beyond this darkness,” she murmured, “if any light remains. Walk well, my child.”

He nodded, for there was nothing else to give. 

Mireth’s hand gripped his shoulder, firm and unyielding. He did not resist. Leaning forward, he pressed his lips to his mother’s brow and lingered, taking with him a last sensation of the warmth of her skin.

Mireth’s voice came low beside his ear. “We must go. Now.”

Brenden let her draw him up. For an instant the world swam—smoke, blood, the faint blue flicker of the dying hearth—and then the cold took him as they slipped through the breach, Eadric still standing there, sentinel in the snow, holding back the night.

He did not turn for a last glimpse of his son. He could not.

The threshold was a cold line beneath his feet. Beyond it, the yard lay empty, snow churned to grey slush where men had fallen. And there, in the ruin’s dim glow, the dark one waited—tall, draped in midnight cloth, the runes of his staff catching the last embers from the burning roof. Snow drifted in thin ribbons, gathering in the folds of his cloak.

Eadric stepped forward, staff gripped tight, knuckles bloodless. The ache in his side was a far-off thing now; the bruises of the day were falling away. The world had narrowed to this yard, this night, and the cold that pressed behind his ribs.

Their eyes met—black and flat as polished iron, reflecting nothing. For a heartbeat, all else stilled; all but the wind that came back to life, like sensing the oncoming battle.

Eadric drew in the cold air that had been his breath for three-and-twenty years. He set the staff’s butt into the snow, pressed palm to breast, and closed his eyes. The fragment beneath the skin burned—a small, ancient agony, deeper than bone. He let the pain climb his spine, fill his mouth with the taste of ash and steel. Once more he called the flame to waking, and bade it give him all it could.

Light leapt from his heart, ran down his arm, pooled in the carved lines of the staff. The runes flared gold and white, brighter than the moon, casting long, hard shadows across the yard. Power surged in his veins—old, hungry—and for a moment his breath faltered beneath its weight.

He opened his eyes. The night stood lit as day, each flake of snow hanging in the glow. The dark one watched—not startled, not eager, but ready.

They circled through the ragged light, boots sinking into sodden ash and mud. Eadric’s chest laboured, flame laced through his bones, breath rough in his throat. Each step was pared to necessity; no wasted motion, no heed for old aches. The world was only the two of them—the pound of his heart, the crackle of heat along the staff.

Their weapons met with a force that shook the teeth, hunger against purpose. White fire raced along Eadric’s staff, flaring where it struck the red. Sparks hissed in the snow, and for an instant the shadows bent back—long and shuddering—across the churned ground.

He slipped beneath a killing arc, twisted, and drove the butt of his staff low. It struck the dark one’s thigh, staggering him half a step. Eadric pressed, feinting right, slipping left—feeling the pull through old scars. But the flame answered, lending his limbs the memory of youth. The next blow drew a sound from his foe—not pain, but surprise.

Staffs locked high above, shoulders straining, light streaming gold and crimson between their faces. Sweat and battle-scars stood plain. In the black eyes before him, for the first time, there was the smallest tremor of doubt.

Eadric bore down, white fire shrieking between his palms, splinters burning into his skin. Snow melted in bursts at their feet, leaving the black earth raw and steaming. He drove forward—once, twice—each step a hammer-blow, each swing forcing the other back.

The dark one snarled, blocking a high arc. The jolt travelled through both their arms. Eadric pressed closer, breath mingling, and saw—beneath the mask—the naked shape of fear.

He seized that moment. Cloak flaring, he leapt; muscle and magic hurled him high over the yard, boots skimming the wrecked fence. Below, the house was a broken shadow; his foe looked up, lips drawn taut. They met in mid-air—staffs arcing white and red. The shock burst outward, ash spiralling in a sudden halo, fragments of roof tumbling in the glare.

He landed hard, knees bending, vision blurring at the edges—but he did not slow.

A cry tore from the dark one—rage, but edged now with doubt. Eadric struck on, blow after blow, driving him back toward the trampled ring where the dead lay. The red light faltered; each block grew slower, each counter drained more of his foe’s strength. The fear was no longer hidden—it widened the eyes, tightened the mouth. One foot slipped in the slush.

Eadric’s blood roared in his ears. Hope flared—a sharp, perilous flame. He poured the fragment’s last gift into the fire, let it consume the air, the night, and every wound borne through the years. The world burned white and gold, each strike ringing with the force of something unleashed for the first and final time.

The enemy faltered, driven to a knee, cloak trailing in the mire. Eadric stepped in, drawing breath through clenched teeth. The staff blazed in his hands, light rolling off him in waves that scattered the snow and set the battered yard aglow. The night rang with the pulse of his power—fierce, unyielding, and whole.

Yet this was no soldier of the common kind, and the fire that dwelt within him had not yet risen from its sleep. He knelt in the churned snow, head bowed, shoulders heaving. Eadric saw the white strain of the knuckles upon the crimson staff, the veins standing sharp against the skin. The enemy’s mouth twisted—not in fear, but in some effort turned inward. A low, guttural sound began in his chest, deep as the grinding of stone. It swelled, rising until it seemed to tremble in the very bones of the earth.

From within him a red light flared—raw, untempered—summoned from marrow and memory. It was not as old as Eadric’s flame, but it was swifter, hungrier. The runes upon the crimson staff kindled, burning fierce and jagged, casting reckless arcs across the ruined yard. Heat rippled outward, sharp enough to sting the skin.

He rose in a single motion, faster than Eadric had thought him able. Their staffs met with a crash that split the night, sparks spiralling into the snow-filled dark. The red light hammered at the white—wild, unrestrained—breaking the rhythm Eadric had held. The force drove his guard high, forearms trembling, boots crunching back through churned snow. His boots skidded back in slush and blood.

Blow for blow, the dark one pressed his attack—each strike younger, harder, driven by a body that had not yet begun to fail. Eadric’s light did not dim, but the strength behind it met an edge it could not turn. The air between them sang, red and gold at war, the ground steaming with each step.

Eadric met his gaze and saw there youth, hunger, and—new-born—certainty. The lips curled in a silent snarl. A sudden feint to the left; then the crimson staff swept across his guard. The shock jarred up Eadric’s arm, and in that instant the old pain returned—a bright, cold flare at the shoulder, the crack of bone.

He yielded ground, unwilling, forced toward the yard’s edge by that untiring force. Another blow struck his ribs; another glanced his thigh. The white fire flared again, but the red matched it stroke for stroke, feeding upon each falter, each slowing step.

Eadric braced, dragged the flame up once more from the fragment’s burning heart. But the dark one’s power came on like a tide, crashing without pause—will and body joined in one last furious rush.

And Eadric was driven to his knees—not because the light forsook him, but because flesh can bear only so much, and time is a blade no magic can turn aside.

The foe’s lips drew back; all fear was gone. The red staff blazed higher, its runes spilling crimson fire across the churned ground. Eadric’s grip faltered. The wood split beneath his hands, runes flickering as the white fire bled away.

A blow came down across his palms; the staff broke in two. Splinters bit his flesh. The next strike crashed into his ribs—bone gave way, and the breath left him in a sharp gasp. Through the pain there flickered the memory of Brenden as a boy, arms looped about his neck, laughter ringing bright as a bell in summer. The memory was already far away, walled off by cold and agony.

He tried to stand, but his legs failed; his boots slid in the mud and snow. The world reeled, dim at the edges. Another blow—shoulder wrenched, the joint torn—his arm fell numb. He dropped again to his knees, the broken staff in one hand, the other pressed into the churned earth. Blood trickled through the cracks between his fingers, steaming in the winter air.

The flame within guttered.

The dark one loomed above, cloak spread wide, red staff lifted high. Eadric looked up through the blur—saw only darkness framed in fire, snow catching in his lashes. Time thinned, brittle as old glass. He tasted blood, sharp on his tongue. The light was gone from his hands; nothing remained but the weight of his body and the memory of warmth.

And far behind him, across a gulf no magic could cross, Maela’s laughter drifted from a year he could not reach.

Forgive me, Maela. I could not hold the world.

The red staff fell—a streak of fire and ruin—and pain narrowed all to a single white line, then to nothing.

In the stillness that followed, memory rose unbidden. He saw his father’s face—not young, not old, but certain as the stone of the hills—watching from beyond the dark.

Did I walk well, Father?

Snow fell. The yard lay silent.

Then the silence broke.

A scream—raw, tearing, defiant—cut through the night, sharp as splintered glass. The dark one turned.

Maela stood in the shattered threshold, one hand gripping the frame for balance. Her tunic clung dark with blood, its weight dragging at the cloth; rivulets ran down her thigh to patter upon the splintered boards. Her hair hung loose, ash caught in the strands, but her eyes burned with a clear and steady fire. She did not call his name. She did not curse him. She only held his gaze, unblinking.

He came toward her slowly. The red staff lowered, its runes still pulsing; his cloak whispered over the ash-strewn floor. Each step was measured, deliberate, like a predator closing the last space to a kill that is beyond escape.

Maela stepped back. One arm clutched her belly, the other dragged along the wall and overturned chairs, fingers scraping wood and stone for purchase. Her breath rasped in her throat. Still she moved, and still she kept her eyes on him.

She passed through the ruin of the room, her feet trailing thin streaks of red across the frost-dusted stones. The heat from the burning rafters had begun to fade, leaving the air heavy with smoke and the cold bite of winter night.

At last she reached the hearth. The rug before it had burned back to the coarse weave, but the wide circle endured: runes cut deep into the stone, the work of her own hands in quieter years—renewed only hours past, when there had still been hope they might hold this ground. Now they lay under a skin of ash and iron dust, faint as breath upon glass, yet holding to their form.

Maela lowered herself to her knees, her breath catching on the pain. Her left hand braced against the hearthstone; her right reached out, fingers trembling, to trace the ring. She felt the familiar grooves beneath her touch—hardened by wax, sealed in powder, the channels now dark with her own blood.

The air shifted. A heat rose there, like it had been waiting, coiled and patient, in the space above the runes.

Her lips parted. Words came—harsh, low, drawn from the deep well of memory—syllables taught to her when her hands were still young and sure. Each fell into place, like the world itself recognized their weight: sinking into the stone, threading through her bones, pulling from her what life the wound had spared.

A shimmer broke from beneath her palm. The runes caught and flared—white as driven snow, old as the First Dawn. The light climbed her arm in jagged leaps, too bright to gaze upon, and for a moment she was a shadow cut against the blaze, framed by ruin and falling snow.

The dark one halted at the door. His eyes narrowed; the line of his mouth bent into something like recognition—then twisted, hard, as the truth struck home.

He lunged. The staff swung up, its crimson light screaming through the air. He crossed the floor in three long strides, cloak snapping behind him, boots scattering shards of broken stone.

Maela’s hand came down hard upon the heart of the circle.

The rune answered. White fire raced up her arm, searing through muscle and bone, filling her mouth with the taste of metal and snow. The light tore through the room, devouring every shadow in a single breathless instant.

For that heartbeat, time stood still.

Then the world was gone—swallowed in a column of light that rose and burst into the winter sky, carrying her, and all within its reach, beyond sight.

--

From the shelter of the pines, Brenden watched the night unmake itself.

The house stood there still—half-collapsed, its eaves burning in sullen flame—until, in the space between breaths, it vanished within a pillar of rising white.

The light made no sound. It took hold of the world in silence, swelling outward until the falling snow turned to glass and the yard became a sea of molten shadow. A wind came with it, bitter and searing at once, heavy with the scent of scorched earth.

He turned his face into Mireth’s cloak, eyes shut tight, but the light followed him—printed deep behind his eyelids, a shape he knew he would never unsee. The ground shuddered once beneath his boots, then lay still. Snow fell in a rush, mingling with drifting ash, and the forest seemed to draw back, holding its breath.

When he dared to look again, the world had changed.

Where the farm had been lay a perfect circle of char—black earth rimmed with new-fallen snow, the last heat lifting in pale threads to the winter air. The fence, the gate, the hearthstone—gone, trying to no hand had ever raised them. No bodies. No fire. Not even ruin. Only stillness, wide and unbroken, like the place had never known life.

Brenden pressed his fists to his eyes, the afterimage burned deep. Something in him longed to cry out, to call back what the night had taken—but the sound would not come. His world was gone, swept to the bone. All that remained was the cold, the murmur of the trees, and the memory of his mother’s flame—brightest at the end, leaving no warmth behind.

The cold settled deeper as the light faded. Only the sigh of wind in the branches and the faint hiss of snow upon burnt earth. He barely felt Mireth’s hand at his shoulder. Not until she knelt before him, blocking the ruin from view, and set her palm against his cheek did he stir.

Her touch was steady, her gaze hollowed by pain and exhaustion, yet unbroken. “We must go down there,” she said, quiet like speaking to the wind.

He rose and followed. The slope fell gently toward what had been the yard. Each step was slow, boots sliding where the snow had hardened to blackened glass. The cold rose through the soles into his bones. The air stank—wood, stone, and flesh all burned together. Ash and smoke curled in loose ribbons about his boots, the ground glimmering faintly where heat still lingered beneath the crust.

All that had been familiar was gone.

The slope where he had played as a boy.

The strip of fence where his mother dried her herbs in summer.

The corner where his father split wood against the winter dusk.

Erased, the land laid bare and strange.

Up close, the ruin gave no shape to grieve—only black earth and heaps of ash, the silence pressing close. They moved along the edge, their steps slow. Now and then Brenden thought he saw the faint hollow of a footprint, but nothing stayed beneath his gaze. No bodies. No broken thing to tell the last moments.

Near where the gate had once stood, a faint gleam broke through the ash. Mireth went to her knees, her hands sifting in the dust until they met something cold and unyielding. She drew it forth—a shard of white, a hand’s span in height, rising of its own accord into the air. It turned slowly, casting a pale light upon the churned ground.

“This was your father’s,” she murmured, her voice barely more than breath.

Brenden stepped forward. The warmth of it brushed his skin—gentle, strange, unlike the flame he had seen blaze from his father’s hands. The fragment pulsed, a heartbeat out of time with his own. He reached for it, hesitated, then closed both hands around it. The light dimmed, settling in his palms. For the briefest moment, he could feel his father’s nearness—tired, proud, and gone.

Mireth searched on, sweeping ash aside until her fingers met the blackened grain of wardwood. She drew free a length scorched but whole, sigils faint along its surface. Not far away lay the second piece, warped by heat, its runes almost lost. She set them together across her knees, her thumb resting on the jagged seam where power had sundered wood.

Then, measuring a the way back to where she reckoned the hearth would be, she crouched again, brushing ash aside until her fingers closed on cold steel. She worked the blades loose, leather dark and stiff, metal biting with winter chill. Without a word, she set the broken staff and the knives into Brenden’s hands. “Keep them,” she said. “And remember.”

He held the fragment in his left, a knife in his right, the weight of it running through his arm and settling deep in his chest, like it had already claimed its place there. Lacking sheaths for the blades, he slid them carefully into the small satchel at his side. From a pocket he drew a length of string, bound the broken halves of the staff together, and fastened the bundle to the back of his belt.

They lingered a while longer. Mireth set her palm to the earth, head bowed, lips moving in a farewell the wind carried away. Brenden followed her lead, his hand pressed to the scorched ground—hot, rough beneath his fingers. For a moment he let memory rise: the scent of porridge at the hearth, the soft rug underfoot, the ache in his palms from splitting wood with his father.His fingers tightened around the fragment until the edges pressed into his skin. The glow was pale—unyielding—trying to the thing had no knowledge of his grief. It pulsed faintly, like the slow beat of something alive, casting its light across the snow-streaked ruin in an unbroken rhythm. And it had cooled, no longer warm as when he first took it.

For a long while, he could not speak. Words felt brittle in his mouth, like they might crumble before they passed his lips. At last, in a voice roughened by cold and ash, he found them.

“What am I to do with this?”

Mireth’s gaze did not waver. She stood like rooted to the blackened earth, the fragment’s light catching along the pale curve of her cheek, the set of her jaw. When she spoke, her voice was low but steady—the kind of tone meant to anchor one who stands at the edge of a sheer drop.

“You cannot carry it as you do now,” she said. “The fragment was never meant to lie loose in the hand. It must be joined to the living heart—bound to the life of its bearer, as it was to your father.”

The word struck him like a stone breaking the still surface of deep water—father—sending ripples through the raw places inside him.

“It was bound… to him?”

“It was,” she said, her eyes dark with memory. “He took it many years ago. He let the fire claim him, as it will claim you if you let it. From that day to this night, it lived in him—burned in him—until his body fell and the fragment returned to the air, waiting for the next who would dare join to it. You are his son, Brenden. It is fitting you should bear it.”

He looked down at it—small, unassuming, cold against his palm—and felt the strange weight of her words. The glow slid over her face as he lifted his eyes again, catching in the green of her gaze, throwing the faintest shadow beneath her jaw.

“And if I refuse?”

Her reply came without hesitation.

“Then I will take it from you and carry it elsewhere. I cannot join to it for my body would not bear it. But the fragment will not rest for long. It will seek another—whether we will it or not. And there are hands abroad that will not hesitate to close around it. You have seen what power it grants. Fallen into the wrong hands, the ruin you see here would spread far beyond this valley—over hills, over kingdoms—until there is no safe hearth left in the world.”

A breath of wind stirred the snow between them, scattering pale dust into the air. The faint scent of char rose with it—iron and ash mingled with the sharp cold.

He closed his fingers more tightly around the shard, feeling its surface unyielding against the tremor in his hand.

“If I take it?”

Her voice softened—not in gentleness, but in gravity.

“Then it will be part of you until your last breath. It will change you—grant you strength, sight, and power not of any mortal birth. But it will test you in the taking, and if you fail that test, you will most likely die. And if you live, there is no road back from it. It will be bound to you—in light, or in death.”

The circle around them was utterly still. The snow that fell into the scorched earth vanished on contact, curling into steam. Brenden felt the heaviness of his limbs—the ache in his shoulders, the raw emptiness left in him where his home had stood only hours before.

His thoughts drifted to his father, standing in the yard with staff ablaze, holding the night itself at bay. To his mother in the doorway, her eyes steady even as the red staff came down. To the white light rising—devouring sky and snow alike—and the silence after, when there was nothing left but the wind and the ruin.

He swallowed hard, the cold burning his throat. Slowly, he lifted his head.

“I will honor my father’s wishes,” he said, his voice steadier than he felt. “And I will continue his legacy.”

He opened his hand, and the fragment’s light spilled across his palm, stark against the dark smear of ash there.

“I will take it.”

Mireth’s expression did not change, but her eyes softened.

“Then lie down,” she said. “Flat, here in the heart of the circle. The ground remembers your father’s flame—it will know what you are doing.”

The scorched earth was still faintly warm against his back as Brenden lowered himself onto it, the grit of ash catching in his hair and clinging to the sweat at his neck. The faint hiss of melting snow whispered along the circle’s edge, trying to the world outside it dared not intrude.

Mireth knelt beside him, her cloak trailing in the ash, her breath visible in the cold air.

“Place it here,” she murmured, guiding his hand until the fragment lay just left of his breastbone. “Flatten your palm over it. Press it in. Do not lift your hand for any reason—pain, fear, or doubt. The flame will enter you. It will search the heart it is asked to join. If you break from it, the fire will turn on you, and there will be no time to save you.”

Her fingers rested briefly at his shoulder—steady, grounding—before drawing back.

“Breathe,” she said again, “and remember who you are.”

At first there was only the weight—the cold of the fragment pressed between his palm and his chest, the steady warmth of the earth beneath his spine, the still air of the circle closing in like a held breath.

Then the heat began.

It came as a thin thread at first, winding from the fragment into his flesh, worming its way between skin and bone. The first heartbeat carried it deeper, curling along the ribs; the next drove it upward toward his throat and downward along the spine. The warmth thickened—each pulse forcing it further—until it was no longer warmth but a slow, deliberate burn.

It spread into the chest, heat layering upon heat, trying to some unseen hand was pressing an iron plate into him. His breath grew shallower. The fire gathered in the hollow behind his sternum, then surged outward into the muscle of his shoulders, the marrow of his arms.

With every heartbeat, it doubled in weight.

The third wave brought a sharp, searing edge, lancing from the fragment through his lungs and into his back. The fourth crushed down with such force that the air fled him in a grunt. He gasped, but each breath only drew more fire inside.

The fifth drove into the spine, climbing rung by rung, each vertebra locking under the strain. His jaw clenched until his teeth ached; the tendons of his neck pulled taut as ship’s rigging under storm wind. The sixth poured into the base of his skull, flooding it with molten weight, each beat a hammer-blow behind the eyes.

By the seventh, his body was no longer his own. The fire threaded into every sinew, every nerve, each one sparking with agony. His vision began to whiten at the edges. His fingers—still flat over the fragment—had gone numb, though he could feel the stone pulsing beneath them, cold no longer but blistering hot.

The pain mounted still. Not in a rush, but in dreadful increments, like it had endless patience to take him apart. His back arched; the grit of ash ground into his skin. A ragged breath tore free, followed by another, sharper.

Then the fire struck deep into the heart itself.

The beat faltered—once, twice—like deciding whether to yield. His ribs felt trying to they would split. The pressure became unbearable, and the sound rose from him before he could stop it: first a hoarse cry, then a full scream, torn raw from his throat, echoing into the winter night.

Every muscle drew tight as a bowstring. His body strained against the earth, trying to the fire inside might lift him from it entirely. The burning became a single, blinding truth—there was no thought, no memory, no world beyond its grasp.

And then, at the very height of it—when he was certain something within must break—everything stopped.

The pain collapsed inward, folding in on itself until it was no more than a deep, molten core. The fire was gone from his skin, yet its echo rang in the hollow spaces within him, like his very bones remembered.

The world around him was gone.

Darkness closed over him—thick, restless, alive with half-born shapes that shifted like smoke before a wind. It was not absence but a presence, watching.

Memory came first.

Maela’s laughter in the kitchen, the light catching in her hair; the smell of bread cooling on the wooden board; the worn handle of the axe in his father’s grip; the frost-white fence rail beneath a winter sunrise; the soft creak of the loft ladder at night; the sound of rain on the thatch while he lay warm beneath the quilt.

Then—images no memory had given him.

A white cliff rising over a sea the colour of molten brass, the horizon shivering with heat.

A city of slender spires, each crowned with fire, beneath a moon black as iron.

A river running red beneath a stone bridge older than any road.

A lone rider crossing a plain where the grass burned in silent flame.

A vault of ancient ice, its walls holding figures locked in sleep.

A marketplace alive with colour and song, where laughter turned suddenly to screaming.

A chain of mountains split open from within, light pouring from the wounds.

A ship with black sails, gliding on a windless sea toward a shore of broken towers.

Faces followed—

An old woman smiling through tears; a young soldier with ash on his cheeks; a child with eyes bright as molten gold; a stranger whose gaze was fixed on him trying to seeing through to the heart.

Others were not of any mortal kind—skin like hammered bronze, eyes veined with light; faces marked with runes that shifted as they breathed; eyes deep as the ocean’s floor, holding storms behind them. Some met his gaze with kinship, some with warning, and some with a hunger that turned the stomach.

Then battle—

Ranks of armored figures clashing on a field drowned in smoke, human lines locked against towering shapes that swung blades the size of gates; great, tusked warriors crashing into shield walls; lithe, long-limbed archers loosing black-feathered shafts from the branches of burning trees. A banner fell into the mud beneath pounding rain, trampled underfoot by a beast the height of a house, its eyes like coals. A wall of shields buckled under the charge of riders crowned in light, their mounts unlike any horse Brenden had known—manes streaming with fire, hooves striking sparks from the sodden ground. Above it all, a shadow the size of mountains moved across the stars, blotting constellations from the sky.

The visions quickened, sharpening into moments that cut like blades.

A child’s hand slipping from his grasp into the dark.

Mireth’s voice calling him from somewhere he could not reach.

A dagger, black and curved, flashing in the light of a dying fire.

The gleam of a golden crown lying abandoned in the dust.

A fortress of white stone sinking into the sea.

A night when two suns burned above the horizon, and the world was silent.

They tangled together—faces, places, cries of battle and whispers in unknown tongues—until the whole of it seemed to draw toward him, threads pulled tight. For an instant that stole his breath, he felt the line that joined them all: to him, to this night, to what must yet be. It was a line stretched taut between the edges of Light and Darkness, and he was bound fast upon it.

The pull loosened. The visions thinned like smoke in the wind. The darkness faded, replaced by the faint hiss of falling snow.

Brenden’s eyes opened to the night sky, pale flakes drifting into his lashes. He lay on his back in the heart of the circle, his palm still pressed to his chest. The fragment was gone. In its place lay a deep, steady ache beneath his ribs, trying to something had been cut away and replaced by a living ember.

His breath came hard, every inhale raw in his throat. The heat clung to him still, rising faintly into the cold air.

A shadow leaned over him—Mireth, her face pale but unshaken.

“It is done,” she said.
