## 📖 About This Project

**Edges of Light** is an ongoing fantasy saga written in a collaborative spirit.  
Readers and writers from around the world are invited to offer ideas, edits, and refinements — working together to shape an immersive story of ancient magic, rising shadows, and heroes forged in grief and glory.

Set in a world where magic is old, sacred, and perilous, the saga follows those who bear the flame of hope against the oncoming dark. From snowbound villages to ruined citadels, from whispered prophecy to open battle, destinies intertwine as choices carve the fate of nations. The journey is vast, the lore deep, and every scene holds the promise of discovery. Here, every voice that joins the telling leaves its mark on the saga.

The text in this repository is the **authoritative edition**, evolving through reader feedback and contributor submissions.  
While open to collaboration, **the story remains under the sole copyright of the author** so it can be formally published in the future.
