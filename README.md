## 📖 About This Project

**Edges of Light** is an ongoing fantasy saga written in a collaborative spirit.  
Readers and writers from around the world are invited to offer ideas, edits, and refinements — working together to shape an immersive story of ancient magic, rising shadows, and heroes forged in grief and glory.

Set in a world where magic is old, sacred, and perilous, the saga follows those who bear the flame of hope against the oncoming dark. From snowbound villages to ruined citadels, from whispered prophecy to open battle, destinies intertwine as choices carve the fate of nations. The journey is vast, the lore deep, and every scene holds the promise of discovery. Here, every voice that joins the telling leaves its mark on the saga.

The text in this repository is the **authoritative edition**, evolving through reader feedback and contributor submissions.  
While open to collaboration, **the story remains under the sole copyright of the author** so it can be formally published in the future.

3. Submit a pull request to the `main` branch.

By submitting a pull request, you agree to the [CLA](CLA.md), which means:

- You grant the author full rights to use your contribution in any format.

### 📝 Using Issues

We use GitHub Issues to track problems, suggest improvements, and discuss ideas.  
If you find a typo, spot an inconsistency in the lore, notice a formatting issue, or have an idea for expanding a scene, please open a new Issue. Be as specific as possible — include chapter numbers, quotes, or links to the relevant section so it’s easy to review. Issues are also welcome for broader feature requests, such as new lore pages or style refinements. This helps keep feedback organized and ensures nothing gets lost.

💡 **Friendly Note for Early Readers**  
Edges of Light is released chapter by chapter, and each book evolves as it’s being written.  
Until a book is fully published in its complete form, chapters and details may still change — sometimes subtly, sometimes dramatically.  
Once a book is published, that edition becomes the stable, authoritative version.
