# Chapter 1: Peace

Snow lay deep upon the fields, a still white mantle pressed over earth and hedge. The dawn came slow, pale light seeping between the ridges that hemmed the vale. Smoke rose from a handful of chimneys along the southern slope, each thin column wavering until the grey sky claimed it. From the farmhouse roof hung spears of ice, and they caught what little light the day could muster while wind whispered through the bare branches of the orchard.

Inside the stone cottage, the hearth held only the ghost of last night's fire. Maela bent over the embers, working the poker until flame licked up again, small but willing. She set the kettle above it and rubbed her hands together, breath warming her knuckles. She turned her head toward the loft, listening for signs of life.

"Up with you, Brenden." Her voice carried warmth despite its firmness. "I know you're awake—I can hear those blankets rustling. The well's iced over thick, and I need water before your father comes wanting his breakfast. And can you hear those hens? They're fussin' like you forgot to feed them yesterday."

From his nest of wool came a groan. The timbers creaked as weight shifted above. His head appeared over the loft's edge, hair standing at angles.

"Still dark," he said, voice thick with sleep. "Can't even see the ridge. Just—" A yawn stretched his jaw wide. "Five more minutes? The blankets are only just getting warm."

"Morning enough for work, and that's all the morning we need." Though her tone softened at the edges. "Come down, love. The frost won't ease for waiting. Your father's been up an hour already—I heard him stirring before the first rooster crowed. I'll make you that porridge you like, with lots of butter and honey."

"All right, all right," he mumbled, surrendering. "I'm coming."

He made his way down the ladder, each rung familiar to his bare feet even in the dimness. His cloak hung loose about his shoulders. At the bottom waited his boots, leather stiff as boards. The hearth's glow reached for him but fell short of true warmth. His mother caught his collar, straightened it, brushed straw from his sleeve. Her fingers lingered.

"Mind the rope at the well. It'll be worse than yesterday—stiff as iron, I'd wager."

He worked his fingers into his gloves, took a breath, and pulled the door. Cold struck like a slap. The yard lay perfect in its whiteness, every fencepost wearing its cap of snow, every branch wrapped in ice that would glitter come full sun. His breath rose in clouds. Each step broke through the night's fresh crust, the sound sharp in the stillness.

The well's stone rim wore frost thick as his thumb. He lifted the iron hook and brought it down hard—once, twice, a third time before the ice gave way. The crack echoed off the barn walls. Shards spun in the black water below as he lowered the bucket, working the rope hand over hand. His mother had been right about the stiffness. By the time he hauled the bucket up, his shoulders burned despite the cold.

The hens' fussing grew louder as he approached the coop. He lifted the latch.

"Yes, I'm here." He kept his voice low, gentle. "You'd think you hadn't eaten in a week."

Grain scattered from his practiced hand. Their heads moved quick and precise, the morning filled with soft clucks and the scratch of claws in straw. One red hen, bold as brass, pecked near his boot.

"Hey now, cheeky," he murmured, nudging her aside with care.

From the barn came the steady rhythm of splitting wood. Brenden followed the sound, bucket pulling at his arm. His father stood among the wood chips, sleeves rolled back, frost in his beard. The axe rose and fell with the certainty of seasons. Each stroke sent another piece to the growing pile.

He paused mid-swing. "Morning, son. Got the water? Good lad. How thick today?"

"Thicker than yesterday. Two fingers, maybe more. Took three strikes to break through proper."

"That's good. Good." His father set the axe head into the block, gave it a twist to seat it firm. "Breaking ice—that's a man's work now. You're old enough to carry it. Getting stronger every season, I see it." A pause, shoulders rolling to ease their stiffness. "Though I half expected to come drag you out myself. Your mother called twice before I heard you stirring."

Brenden shifted the bucket between his hands. "She woke me. I was just... the loft gets cold. Colder than usual last night."

A low chuckle rumbled in his father's chest. "You're fortunate, having her voice to wake to. My father used his boot—not kicked, mind you, just prodded until I couldn't ignore it anymore. Used to say the heel worked better than the tongue for rousing boys." His eyes held memory and mirth in equal measure. "Never saw him proved wrong on that count. Some mornings I can still feel that boot finding my ribs."

"You're welcome up to my loft anytime, Da," Brenden said, shifting the bucket between his hands. "See how you like the climb."

"Go on." His father's voice gentled. "Warm yourself. Your lips are near blue, and your mother will blame me for it. Just a few more logs to split. Tell her I'll want something hot, if she's got it."

"She promised me porridge with lots of butter and honey," Brenden said, heading for the door. "But I'm just bringing the water now, so it'll be a few minutes yet."

"All right then. I'll be along shortly." The axe rose and fell again, steady as breathing.

The yard crunched beneath his steps. Beyond the barn, the pasture rolled endless and pale toward the river, where ice gripped the banks like desperate fingers. The northern ridge stood black with pine, wearing a crown of mist. A crow passed overhead, its call rough against the quiet. Somewhere distant, a dog barked once and thought better of it.

Inside, bread warmed near the fire, its smell filling every corner. His mother turned as he entered, brushed hair from her brow with the back of one flour-dusted hand. She took the bucket without his offering it.

"Your hands—I can see them shaking from here. Stone-cold, aren't they? Sit. I'll have food ready before the feeling comes back to your fingers."

"I told Da about the porridge," Brenden said, settling onto the bench. "He'll be along shortly."

She nodded, pouring the fresh water into the large pot. "Should've brought a bucket in last night like I said. This'll take an age to heat." She hung it over the fire, then turned to a smaller pot already steaming. "Good thing I melted some snow earlier, or we'd be waiting till noon for breakfast."

He held his hands above the flames, enduring the needles that came with returning warmth. The bench knew him, worn smooth in his particular spot. She worked steadily, stirring the oats, adding milk from the pitcher. The porridge thickened slowly, filling the cottage with its warm smell.

When steam rose thick from the pot and the oats looked ready, she glanced toward the door. "Where's that father of yours? Said he'd be along shortly, didn't he?"

"Still splitting, I'd guess."

She wiped her hands on her apron and went to the door, pulling it open despite the cold. "Eadric! Porridge is ready!"

From the barn came a muffled shout. "Coming now!"

She shut the door against the cold and returned to the hearth, reaching for the honey pot. "That man." She spooned honey generously over the porridge.

Soon the door opened to admit his father, stamping free of snow, ice falling in small chunks from his boots. The axe found its place beside the door. He pulled off his gloves finger by finger, working feeling back into his hands.

"Old Thistle?" his mother asked, setting the bowl on the table as she spoke.

"Buried in straw like he's planning to sleep through winter entire." His father settled onto the bench, joints protesting quietly. "Can't say I blame him. He'll stir when he realizes we're eating without him. Never known him to miss a meal by choice."

Brenden ate quietly, spoon rising and falling in a steady rhythm. The honey was generous, sweet on his tongue, and the warmth of the porridge spread through him as the fire glowed nearby.

She ruffled his hair in passing. "This one at least wakes when called. Eventually. After only two or three attempts."

"I was awake," Brenden said, but without much conviction. "Just... considering the day."

"Considering it," his father smirked, "that's a fine name for snoring under blankets. I did a fair bit of 'considering' myself while staring at that woodpile, till my hands finally gave in and did the work."

He tore thick pieces of bread and let them soften in his bowl until they nearly dissolved. "Mice again," Maela said. "Tracks across the flour bin, droppings by the salt."

"Getting in somewhere," Eadric muttered, frowning at the walls. "I'll check for gaps today. The frost opens cracks where you'd never expect."

Quiet chewing filled the table for a time. Then Brenden spoke up. "That red hen," he said around a mouthful of porridge, "the one with the tail that sits crooked? She went for my boot this morning. Nearly sent the bucket flying."

"Always been pushy, that one." Maela finally sat with her own bowl. "Reminds me of certain folk I know, always nudging to be first at the pot."

Eadric raised his brows in mock innocence. Maela laughed, setting down her spoon. Wind pressed at the shutters, and the three of them went on with their meal. He reached for the bread, she poured the tea, and the table was filled with the muffled sound of eating and the scrape of bowls.
