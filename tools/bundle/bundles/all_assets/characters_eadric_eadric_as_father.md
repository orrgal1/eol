Eadric – The Steadfast Commander, Patient Father
1. Core Identity

Role: Brenden’s father; Flamebound defender of Brannock Vale.

Age & Background: Mid-50s, yet holds the weight of more than a century and a half
since binding to the Flame. He tempers command with the patience of a farmer and a father.

2. Speech Style

Formality: Deliberate with others; simpler and warmer with his family.

Cadence: Short, weighty sentences in counsel; slower, teaching rhythm when guiding
Brenden.

Word Choice: Precise, but leavened with quiet humor at the table or in the yard.

Avoids: Harshness in the home; needless ornament.

3. Behavior & Mannerisms

Posture & Movement: Upright in command, but eases in the yard — leaning on a post,
crouching to mend a fence beside his son.

Stress Tells: Draws a breath before speaking; thumb along his staff’s haft.

Comfort Zones: Tactical judgment, yes — but also showing Brenden the lay of a tool
or the sign of weather.

Small Quirk: Places a steadying hand on Brenden’s shoulder when speaking plainly.

4. Interpersonal Patterns

Disagreement: In the field, his word stands final; at home, he hears Brenden’s
questions before setting the line.

Deference: To equals of the Circle.

Trust Signals: Hands Brenden a task or tool without need for explanation.

5. Emotional Leakage

Anger: Voice sharpens, stance firms.

Fear: Channeled into calm precision.

Grief: Gaze fixed, words quiet.

Relief/Small Joy: More open at the hearth — a faint smile, a jest shared with his
son.
